*This EULA applies to the Stratus Software Products and any third party software programs (such as EMC software products) that are supplied by Stratus or its resellers but that are not packaged with a separate end-user license agreement (the Stratus Software Products and such third party software programs collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Products").

1

Software License. Except for the limited use right set forth in this Section 1, Stratus and its licensors ("Licensors")

shall own all right, title and interest in and to the Products and any copies of the Products. The Products are licensed,

not sold. Any updates, supplements, corrections or bug fixes for the Products will be governed by the terms of this

EULA.

1.1

You acknowledge that you have only a non-exclusive and limited right to use the object code version of the Products

on a single ftServer system and the applicable peripheral devices (including without limitation storage equipment)

sold to you by Stratus or its authorized distributor or reseller (collectively, the "System") in accordance with this

EULA. You may make a single copy of the Products in object code form for archival or backup purposes. You may

not remove or obscure any proprietary rights notice, Restricted Rights legend (as defined in section 1.4 below) or

other notice (collectively, "Notices") included with the Products. You must include all Notices on all copies of the

Products. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Products or attempt to gain access to the

source code for the Products, except and only to the extent that it is expressly permitted by applicable law, and, to the

extent applicable law permits contractual waiver of such right, you hereby waive your rights to do so.

1.2

Provided you have not breached any of your duties or obligations under this EULA, you may permanently transfer the

Products and all rights under this EULA only as part of a one-time sale or transfer of the System on which the

Products are installed and only to a transferee who agrees to be bound by all of the terms and conditions set forth in

this EULA. Upon such transfer, you agree that you will (1) transfer all of the Products with the System, (2) retain no

copies of the Products, and (3) assign all rights and delegate all obligations under this EULA to your transferee. You

will not otherwise transfer or assign the Products or this EULA and/or any rights or obligations hereunder without the

prior written consent of Stratus.

1.3

Without prejudice to any other rights, Stratus has the right to terminate this EULA and refuse to ship any Products if

you fail to pay any relevant license fees or other charges. Your rights under this EULA will automatically terminate if

you breach any of your material obligations under this EULA. Upon any termination of this EULA, you will return to

Stratus or its designee, or if instructed by Stratus to do so, destroy all copies of the Products promptly after such

termination.

1.4

The Products include commercial computer software that has been developed entirely at private expense and is

regularly used for non-governmental purposes and licensed to the public. All software provided to the U.S.

Government is provided with "Restricted Rights" as provided in FAR, 48 CFR 52.227-14 (JUNE 1987) or DFAR 48

CFR 252.227-7013 (OCT 1988), as applicable. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

2

Confidentiality. You acknowledge that the Products embody trade secrets and proprietary information and materials of

Stratus and its Licensors ("Confidential Information"). You agree not to disclose such Confidential Information to any

third party. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree to treat the Confidential Information with at least the same

degree of care with which you treat your own confidential information of like importance, but in no event will you

s066us.doc

treat such Confidential Information with less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the above, you will have no liability with regard to any Confidential Information that (1) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no fault of you, (2) was known to you, without restriction, at the time of disclosure, (3) was independently developed by you without any use of or reference to the Confidential Information, or (4) is disclosed pursuant to a valid order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that you promptly furnish to Stratus notice of such requirement or order enabling Stratus and its Licensors to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure.

3

Infringement Indemnity.

3.1

Stratus will defend any claim brought against you alleging that the Products infringe a patent or copyright in your

jurisdiction, and will indemnify you against all damages and costs finally awarded against you provided that Stratus is

notified promptly in writing of the claim and given full authority, information and assistance for the defense and/or

settlement of such claim, which defense and/or settlement will be under the sole control of Stratus. If a claim has

occurred, or in Stratus' opinion is likely to occur, you agree to permit Stratus, at its sole option and expense, to (1)

procure for you the right to continue using the Products, or (2) to replace or modify the Products so that they are non-

infringing. If in Stratus' sole judgment neither of the foregoing alternatives is commercially practicable, Stratus may

terminate this license, remove the Products and refund to you the product use fees as depreciated or amortized by an

equal annual amount over the lifetime of the Products taking into account generally accepted accounting practices.

3.2

Neither Stratus, nor its affiliates, subsidiaries nor the Licensors will have any liability for any claim based upon or

arising out of (1) the combination, operation or use of the Products with (a) any Microsoft or other third party

software programs, (b) any equipment, devices or software not supplied by Stratus, or (2) the alteration or

modification of any Products. To the full extent permitted by law, this section states the entire liability of

Stratus, its affiliates, subsidiaries and the Licensors and your sole remedy with respect to any claim of

infringement.

4

Limited Warranty.

4.1

Stratus warrants that the media containing each Product will be free from defects in material and workmanship for

thirty (30) days from the date of receipt. Stratus' sole liability and your exclusive remedy for such defective Product

media will be to replace the defective media free of charge. You may obtain information for reporting warranty

defects from your Products supplier or vendor or from the Stratus web site at "www.stratus.com".

4.2

Stratus does not represent or warrant that the Products will operate without interruption or will be error free. This

warranty does not apply to defects attributable to (1) modification or alteration of the Products made without the prior

written approval of Stratus, (2) accident, neglect, misuse or abuse, or (3) exposure to conditions outside the range of

the environmental, power and operating specifications provided by Stratus.

5

Disclaimer And Limitation of Liability:

5.1

Except as expressly set forth in this EULA, neither Stratus, its affiliates, subsidiaries nor the Licensors make

any other warranties, express or implied, including any implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a

particular purpose. Stratus, its affiliates, subsidiaries and the Licensors expressly disclaim all warranties not

stated in this EULA. Any implied warranties that may be imposed by law are limited to the terms contained in

this EULA to the maximum extent permitted by law.

5.2

Except for damages or losses related to death or bodily injury, in no event will Stratus, its affiliates,

subsidiaries or the Licensors, be liable for any special, indirect, punitive, incidental or consequential damages

or losses (including without limitation loss of use, data, profit, savings or business), whatever the basis of the

claim or action (such as breach of warranty, condition, contract, infringement and tort, including strict liability

and negligence, or other legal theory) even if advised of the possibility of such damages or if such possibility

was reasonably foreseeable. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the liability of Stratus, its affiliates,

subsidiaries and the Licensors for damages or losses for any cause whatsoever, and regardless of the basis of

the claim or action will be limited to the amount you actually paid for the specific Product that caused the

damages or losses. Because some states or countries do not allow a limitation on the duration of an implied warranty

or the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, the above limitations and/or exclusions may not apply to you.

6

Import / Export. You acknowledge that the Products are of U.S. origin and are subject to U.S. Export

Administration, international and national import and export control laws and regulations, including end-user, end-use

and destination restrictions issued by the U.S. and other governments ("Import and Export Controls"). You agree that

exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further right hereunder. The

invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this EULA will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other

provision, the remaining provisions being deemed to continue in full force and effect.

7.3

otherwise available to it to protect the intellectual property, proprietary rights and Confidential Information of itself and

Form.
C. Distribution Rights. Licensee may distribute Distributable Components (including when modified per Section 3(a)(3)B (Modification Rights) above), provided that either (a) such Distributable Components have been converted into a machine executable form, such as in the case of a Core or Design Element, a Bitstream, and in the case of a Driver, in compiled object code form; or (b) the recipient thereof has a valid license from Xilinx to use the same Software. In all cases Distributable Components shall be distributed only for use to program a Xilinx Device.
(b) Third-Party and Open Source Licenses. Certain files, programs or other materials distributed in connection with the Software may originate from third-party licensors and/or are licensed to Licensee (not under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, but rather) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable licenses that appear upon installation, acceptance and/or activation of the Software and/or are contained or described in the corresponding release notes or other documentation or header or source files. Such files, programs or other materials may be subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License or other open source or free software licenses. Licensee agrees to carefully review and abide by the terms and conditions of these licenses to the extent that they govern such files, programs or other materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as between Xilinx and Licensee, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and if not prohibited by any such third-party and/or open source licenses, all such files, programs or other materials shall be deemed covered under Sections 10 (Disclaimers) and 11 (Limitation of Liability) and 14(c) (Governing Law) of this Agreement.
4. Restrictions.
(a) Special Use Restrictions. No right is granted hereunder to use the Software or any Bitstream generated by use of the Software to program or develop designs for non-Xilinx Devices; however, Licensee may port ASIC designs to Xilinx Devices for the purpose of prototyping and verification. Furthermore, the Hardware Manager tool contained within the Software may be used to program devices solely for prototype purposes, and Xilinx specifically disclaims any liability for results obtained from use of the Hardware Manager tool to program devices for production purposes.
(b) General Restrictions. Except only to the extent otherwise expressly allowed under Section 3 (License Grants) above (or under applicable laws notwithstanding these restrictions), Licensee is not licensed to, and agrees not to: (i) decompile, translate, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce to human readable form the Software or the data files generated by the Software; (ii) transmit the Software or display the object code of the Software on any computer screen, or make any hard-copy memory dumps of the object code; (iii) publish or disclose the results of any benchmarking of the Software, or use such results for any other software development activities; (iv) make any copies of the Software, except to make one (1) copy of the Software in machine-readable form solely for backup purposes; (v) modify or prepare derivative works of the Software, in whole or in part; (vi) hypothecate, rent, lease, loan, lend, timeshare, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Software to any other individual, corporation or other legal entity; or (vii) remove, alter or obscure any product identification, ownership or intellectual property rights notices on or in the Software.
5. Payment; Taxes.
(a) Payment. Xilinx may invoice Licensee for the license fee identified by Xilinx to Licensee in connection with this Agreement. Licensee shall pay Xilinx' invoices in full thirty (30) days after the invoice date, without any deduction, counterclaim or offset. Overdue amounts shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or at the highest legal interest rate, if less. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Xilinx may require pre-payment or other security, depending on Xilinx' credit review or Licensee's payment history or changes in financial condition. If Licensee's procedures require that an invoice be submitted against a purchase order before payment can be made, Licensee will be responsible for issuing such purchase order thirty (30) days before the payment due date. In cases where license fees have been pre-paid under a Xilinx Productivity Advantage (XPA) or similar arrangement, the outstanding budget available to Licensee will be reduced by the amount of the license fee.
(b) Transfer Taxes. The amounts payable to Xilinx pursuant to this Agreement are exclusive of any sales or use or other taxes or governmental charges. Licensee shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes or charges, except
file:///C/.../lammers/Documents/automation/EULAs/2020.1/end-user-license-agreement_ug1420/unified_xilinx_eulas%20(for%202020_01).txt[5/4/2020 4:08:43 PM]

for any taxes based solely on Xilinx's net income. If applicable, Licensee will provide Xilinx with valid certification of any exemption from tax or reduced rate of tax imposed by any applicable taxing authority at the time of order.
(c) Withholding Taxes. If Licensee is required by applicable law to apply withholding taxes, Licensee shall provide Xilinx with advance notification of the requirement to apply such taxes and shall take all allowable actions requested by Xilinx that will reduce the withholding tax liability regarding transactions under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, applying on its own or on Xilinx' behalf for reduced withholding rates, concessionary tax rates or other favorable tax treatment. Licensee shall comply with applicable tax laws and regulations at its sole expense. Licensee will assist Xilinx' efforts to obtain allowable tax credits or deductions for withholding taxes by providing to Xilinx, in a form acceptable to Licensee, original or certified copies of tax payments receipts or other evidence of payment of taxes withheld by Licensee regarding payments made under this Agreement.
6. Ownership. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all intellectual property and industrial rights in and to the Software and all copies thereof are and will remain the sole property of Xilinx (or its licensors, as applicable). Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as conferring by implication, estoppel or otherwise upon Licensee any license or other right except the licenses and rights expressly granted to Licensee in Section 3 (License Grants). The Software is protected by laws and international treaty provisions covering intellectual property rights. With respect to any files, programs or other materials distributed in connection with the Software that have been licensed to Xilinx from third parties and which are not governed by a separate license as mentioned in Section 3(b) (Third-Party and Open Source Licenses) above, such third parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of the terms of this Agreement.
7. Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in Section 3 (License Grants), Licensee shall (a) maintain the confidentiality of the Software as the proprietary trade secrets of Xilinx (or its licensors, as applicable); and (b) not make the Software available in any form to any person other than to its Users who have a genuine "need to know" for purposes authorized by this Agreement, and who are bound by obligations of confidentiality no less protective of Xilinx (or its licensors, as applicable) than those contained herein. Licensee represents to Xilinx that it maintains a system of confidentiality consistent with commonly accepted practices to protect its own confidential business information, including written agreements with its Users, and that the Software will be protected by such a system to the same extent, but in no event with less than reasonable care. Licensee agrees that a breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable and continuing damage to Xilinx for which there may be no adequate remedy at law, and Xilinx shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and/or a decree for specific performance, and such other relief (including monetary damages) as may be proper.
8. Updates; Support. Any Updates that are provided to Licensee shall be deemed and treated the same as the "Software" under this Agreement for which such Update applies. Also, any support (whether provided via the Xilinx technical support website or otherwise) for the Software provided to Licensee shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
9. Limited Warranty and Sole Remedy. Xilinx warrants that, for a period of ninety (90) days from the first date of issuance to Licensee of the Authorization Codes for a Seat (the "Warranty Period"), any media on which the Software may be furnished will, under normal use, be free from defects in material and workmanship. If Licensee reports in writing to Xilinx a breach of the foregoing warranty during the Warranty Period, Xilinx, at its option, after return of the defective software media, will either replace such media or refund the applicable license fee received by Xilinx and terminate this Agreement. The foregoing describes the sole liability of Xilinx and the exclusive remedy of Licensee with respect to any breach of the foregoing limited warranty.
10. DISCLAIMERS.
(A) EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING SUPPORT, IF ANY) IS PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. XILINX AND ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. XILINX DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN
file:///C/.../lammers/Documents/automation/EULAs/2020.1/end-user-license-agreement_ug1420/unified_xilinx_eulas%20(for%202020_01).txt[5/4/2020 4:08:43 PM]

THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT THE DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED. FURTHERMORE, XILINX DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING SUPPORT, IF ANY) IN TERMS OF CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.
(B) LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER FUNCTIONALITY, SOFTWARE OR PROTOCOLS MAY REQUIRE LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES AND LICENSEE ACCEPTS SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OBTAINING SUCH LICENSES.
(C) THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE FAIL-SAFE, OR FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY APPLICATION REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN LIFESUPPORT OR SAFETY DEVICES OR SYSTEMS, CLASS III MEDICAL DEVICES, NUCLEAR FACILITIES, APPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF AIRBAGS, OR ANY OTHER APPLICATIONS THAT COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY OR SEVERE PROPERTY OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE (INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY, "CRITICAL APPLICATIONS"). FURTHERMORE, THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY APPLICATIONS THAT AFFECT CONTROL OF A VEHICLE OR AIRCRAFT, UNLESS THERE IS A FAIL-SAFE OR REDUNDANCY FEATURE (WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE USE OF SOFTWARE IN THE XILINX DEVICE TO IMPLEMENT THE REDUNDANCY) AND A WARNING SIGNAL UPON FAILURE TO THE OPERATOR. LICENSEE AGREES, PRIOR TO USING OR DISTRIBUTING ANY SYSTEMS THAT WERE DEVELOPED BY USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THAT INCORPORATE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE, TO THOROUGHLY TEST THE SAME FOR SAFETY PURPOSES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSEE ASSUMES THE SOLE RISK AND LIABILITY OF ANY CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.
11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (1) IN NO EVENT SHALL XILINX OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS, OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING UNDER, RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY; (2) IN NO EVENT SHALL XILINX' OR ITS LICENSORS' ENTIRE LIABILITY ARISING UNDER, RELATED TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF LICENSE AND SUPPORT FEES RECEIVED BY XILINX FROM LICENSEE FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; (3) THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF SUCH LOSS WAS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OR IF XILINX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND (4) THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDIES HEREIN.
12. Termination. This Agreement shall be effective until terminated as follows. If the Software licensed hereunder is only for trial or evaluation purposes (as set by the Authorization Codes), then (a) this Agreement and all rights hereunder shall automatically terminate on a date determined by the Authorization Codes (typically 30 or 60 or 90 days) or earlier upon notice by Xilinx, and (b) certain features and functions of the Software may be disabled by Xilinx during the trial/evaluation period. Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying the Software and all copies thereof. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Xilinx if Licensee fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions herein. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee must destroy the Software and all copies thereof. The following provisions of this Agreement survive its termination: 1 (Definitions) and all defined terms, 2 (Authorization Codes), 3b (Third-Party and Open Source Licenses) to the extent not separately terminated according to the terms of such licenses, 4 (Restrictions), 5 (Payment; Taxes) for all unpaid amounts, 6 (Ownership), 7 (Confidentiality), 10 (Disclaimers), 11 (Limitation of Liability), 12 (Termination), 13 (WebTalk Notice, Consent and Opt-Out) and 14 (General).

file:///C/.../lammers/Documents/automation/EULAs/2020.1/end-user-license-agreement_ug1420/unified_xilinx_eulas%20(for%202020_01).txt[5/4/2020 4:08:43 PM]

(a) Collection and Transmission of Data. "WebTalk" is a feature of the Software that electronically transmits to Xilinx various data relating to Licensee's use of the Software. WebTalk does not transmit the actual logic designs or Bitstreams processed via the Software. The types of data that WebTalk will transmit to Xilinx include: (i) constraint data (e.g., location assignments, clock and timing requirement and assignments, any constraints set via the Software graphical user interface), (ii) device data (e.g., targeted device and family), (iii) compilation data (e.g., device, memory and I/O utilization, time of compilation), (iv) design data (e.g., the number of each type of file used, intellectual property cores/LogiCORE IP cores logic functions used, and intellectual property parameterization), (v) Software data (e.g., synthesis, simulation and timing analysis tools used, and version and build of the Software), (vi) platform data (e.g., operating system, speed and number of processors and main memory), (vii) Authorization Codes data, (viii) Software errors log data (e.g., previous exit status), and (ix) help access data. Xilinx may correlate the data collected by WebTalk (primarily via the Authorization Codes data) to determine the identity of the Licensee and the User. WebTalk functions by bundling the collected data resulting from your use of the Software and writing it to html and/or xml files which are electronically transmitted over the internet to Xilinx by https (hypertext transfer protocol secure) post. WebTalk collects and maintains the last usage_statistics_webtalk file that was meant for transmission for a given design. Every new re-compilation of that given design will overwrite the previous file. If the https post transmission fails, or an internet connection is not available at the time of attempted transmission, the data is stored as an html and/or xml file. Once an internet connection is achieved by Licensee, the https post transmission will again be attempted upon recompilation. The operation of WebTalk will not materially affect the performance of the Software.
(b) Use, Protection and Disclosure of Data. Xilinx uses the data received via WebTalk so that Xilinx can continuously improve the Software and other products, technologies and services that Xilinx offers to its customers, and also for sales and marketing email communications (for example, for selective announcement of new Xilinx products and services, distribution of marketing data, etc.). Xilinx uses reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of the data during transmission (as discussed above) and after receipt by Xilinx via "firewalls" and other commonly available physical and technical security measures. However, due to technological limitations, the transmission of data through various internet service providers not under contract with Xilinx, and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, Xilinx cannot completely assure Licensee or Users, and Licensee and Users should not expect, that the data will be absolutely protected or confidential. If you attempt to tamper with or modify the Software in any way (other than as expressly authorized by Xilinx in this Agreement), Xilinx disclaims all responsibility for the operation of WebTalk and for the collection, transmission and protection of data as described herein. Xilinx may disclose data received via WebTalk to its corporate subsidiaries and to its authorized distributors and sales representatives (collectively, "Sales Partners"), which disclosures may be in a form that may be correlated to personally identify Licensee and Users, for their use of such data in the same manner as Xilinx might use such data. Except for disclosures to its Sales Partners, the data received by Xilinx via WebTalk will not be intentionally disclosed by Xilinx to any third parties in a form that is knowingly capable of being correlated to personally identify Licensee and its Users; however, Xilinx may share this data in an aggregate form that does not knowingly identify Licensee and its Users with its business affiliates including without limitation electronic design automation (EDA) companies with whom Xilinx has a commercial relationship including, but not limited to, Synopsys, Mentor Graphics, and Cadence. Xilinx also seeks to require Sales Partners and business affiliates to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the data disclosed to them. In addition to disclosures to Sales Partners, Xilinx may disclose personally identifiable data (collected by WebTalk and correlated to Licensee and Users), with or without prior notice, when Xilinx believes that the law requires it, in response to subpoenas or at the demand of governmental agencies, to protect its systems or business, or to respond to an emergency. Further, Xilinx reserves the right to transfer any and all data collected by WebTalk from Licensee and Users to a third party in the event that Xilinx sells or transfers substantially all of its assets related to the Software to such third party.
(c) Enable/Disable. Please note that WebTalk will collect and transmit certain data that may contain (or be correlated to reveal, primarily via the Authorization Codes data) personally identifiable information. By agreeing to this Agreement, you hereby give your consent (on behalf of Licensee and Users) for Xilinx to use and disclose this information anywhere in the world for the purposes and as described in this Agreement. Licensee or its Users may disable/enable WebTalk during installation or by editing the user preferences in the WebTalk options. Please note that WebTalk data transmission is mandatory for WebPACK Edition (which is made available by Xilinx at no charge), and WebTalk makes decisions on data transmission based on the Authorization Codes used for design compilation; the only exception to this mandatory transmission is if the software is used on a machine that is not connected to the internet. If

5. PAYMENTS; TAXES; AUDIT
5.1 Payments: Unless Company is purchasing the McAfee Enterprise Products through an Authorized Partner, in which case payment obligations will be exclusively between the Authorized Partner and Company, Company will pay Musarubra the fees for the Musarubra Product within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Late payments are subject to interest of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and nonrefundable. If Company considers an invoice is incorrect, Company must contact Musarubra in writing within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice to request an adjustment or credit.
5.2 Transaction Taxes: If Company purchases the McAfee Enterprise Products directly from Musarubra for use or resale, Company will pay all applicable transaction taxes, including sales and use taxes, value added taxes, duties, customs, tariffs, and other government-imposed transactional charges however designated (and any related interest or penalty) on amounts payable by Company under this Agreement (Transaction Taxes). Musarubra will separately state on its invoices the Transaction Taxes that Musarubra is required to collect from Company under applicable law. Company will provide proof of any exemption from Transaction Taxes to Musarubra at least fifteen (15) Business Days before the due date for paying an invoice. If Musarubra does not collect the required Transaction Taxes from Company but is subsequently required to remit the Transaction Taxes to any taxing authority, Company will promptly reimburse Musarubra for the Transaction Taxes, including any accrued penalty or interest charges if the failure to timely collect and remit was not due to the fault of Musarubra.

If Musarubra provides Company with valid and official documentation issued by the relevant taxing authority for a lower rate of Withholding Taxes, then Company will apply the lower rate.
5.4 If Company purchases the McAfee Enterprise Products through an Authorized Partner, the obligations regarding Transaction Taxes or Withholding Taxes will be the exclusive responsibility of the Authorized Partner or Company, and the rules in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 do not apply as between Musarubra and Company.

5.6 Audit: Musarubra may request, and Company must provide within thirty (30) days from the request date, a Software-facilitated system-generated report (System Report) verifying Company's Software deployment.

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
Per Device Licenses and the Software cannot be transferred except to the extent permitted under Section 8 (General Transferability Rights of Licenses).
(ii) Per Subscriber Licensing. Where the Software is subject to a license fee that is calculated per subscriber, or based on a specified block of subscribers (as set out in Sandvine's quotation), such Software shall be deemed to be subject to a "Per Subscriber License". A Per Subscriber License permits End User to use the Software in connection with the delivery of the functionality enabled by the Software to up to the specified number of Subscribers (as defined below) covered by the applicable license fee. The Software license grant shall be one (1) year, unless another license term is expressly set out in Sandvine's quotation.
Provided that End User is enrolled for Support and Maintenance Services coverage in respect of the Software, a Per Subscriber License and Software shall be transferable between Devices, subject to the following: (a) transfers may only occur within End User's own network and Per Subscriber Licenses cannot be transferred to any third party including, without limitation, End User's affiliates or subsidiaries, except to the extent permitted under Section 8 (General Transferability Rights of Licenses); (b) licenses covering specified block numbers of Subscribers must be transferred in whole and may not be broken down into smaller blocks or units; and (c) licenses can only be transferred between Devices that operate on the same base platform operating system and architecture.

The transferability of a Per Subscriber License as permitted hereunder does not grant or create any right of exchange in favor of any future version of Software required to operate on a different base platform operating system or different architecture.
(iii) Per Bandwidth Licensing. Where the Software is subject to a license fee that is calculated per bandwidth, or based on a specified amount of bandwidth (as set out in Sandvine's quotation), such Software shall be deemed to be subject to a "Per Bandwidth License".

(iv) Per Virtual CPU Licensing. Where the Software is subject to a license fee that is calculated per virtual central processing unit ("CPU") (as set out in Sandvine's quotation), such Software shall be deemed to be subject to a "Per Virtual CPU License". A Per Virtual CPU License permits End User to use such Software on that number of virtual CPUs and where each such Per Virtual CPU License is coupled with another Software license, End User shall pay all applicable license fees. The Software license grant for Per Virtual CPU Licensing shall be one (1) year, unless another license term is expressly set out in Sandvine's quotation.
Provided that End User is enrolled for Support and Maintenance Services coverage in respect of the Software, a Per Virtual CPU License shall be transferable between Devices, provided that such transfers may only occur within End User's own network and Per Virtual CPU Licenses cannot be transferred to any third party including, without limitation, End User's affiliates or subsidiaries, except to the extent permitted under Section 8 (General Transferability Rights of Licenses).

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

(v) Cloud Software Licensing. Cloud Software is licensed on annual subscription basis (or as set out in Sandvine's quotation) either: (a) per Site, or (b) per Provisioned Cloud Subscriber. The annual subscription period shall commence on the later of: (A) the date the Cloud Software is made accessible or available to End User; and (B) the commencement date of the annual term set out in Sandvine's quotation. The End User must renew the annual subscription to the Cloud Software prior to the expiry of the annual subscription in order to continue to use the Cloud Software. To renew the annual subscription, the End User must place an order with Sandvine pursuant to a Sandvine issued quotation. Sandvine shall invoice End User for all Sites and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers in advance and payment is due thirty (30) days following the date of the invoice and such payment shall be non-refundable. "Site" means an End User location that: (I) has physical network connectivity, and (II) utilizes the network management functionality of the Cloud Software. "Provisioned Cloud Subscriber" means each unique subscriber with provisioned access to a wireless network who have generated traffic on the network during the preceding thirty (30) day period from the point of measurement. Cloud Software licenses cannot be transferred to any third party including, without limitation, End User's affiliates or subsidiaries.
4. License Verification and Reconciliation.
(i) Per Subscriber License, Per Bandwidth License, and Per Virtual CPU License. For Per Subscriber Licenses, Per Bandwidth Licenses, and Per Virtual CPU Licenses, End User's scope of deployment and use of the licenses shall be verified and reconciled on a periodic basis by Sandvine. At Sandvine's sole discretion, Sandvine may collect and use some, all or none of the following usage metrics, or other metrics not listed: the total number of Products and Third Party Items deployed, the amount of bandwidth used, the total number of subscribers, the Software Modules that are deployed, the various Software features that have been activated and, in the case of a Per Virtual CPU License, the number of virtual CPUs. If Sandvine's verification and reconciliation indicates that additional Per Subscriber Licenses, additional Per Bandwidth Licenses, or additional Per Virtual CPU Licenses are required based on End User's actual usage, the applicable fees shall be calculated by Sandvine and payable by End User commencing from the start of applicable Sandvine review period. For example, if Sandvine's verification and reconciliation conducted as of September 30th for the period September 1 until September 30 indicates that additional Per Subscriber Licenses are required during that period, the applicable license fees, and corresponding Support and Maintenance Service fees, shall be calculated and payable from September 1 onwards. It is expected that End User will be operating Sandvine's License Manager in "online" mode. If End User is operating Sandvine's License Manager in "offline" mode, then End User or someone on behalf of End User must perform a procedure on a periodic basis (approximately, once every 90 days) that enables Sandvine to collect the metrics described above. If metrics indicate that additional Per Subscriber Licenses, additional Per Bandwidth Licenses, or additional Per Virtual CPU Licenses are required based on End User's actual usage, the applicable fees shall be calculated by Sandvine and payable by End User commencing from the start of applicable Sandvine review period.
(ii) Cloud Software.
a. Monthly Verification. For Cloud Software, End User's scope of deployment and use of Cloud Software shall be verified and reconciled as of the last day of each month. The verification shall be based on the 95th percentile of daily activated sites measured over the month ("Monthly Verification"). In order to facilitate the Monthly Verification, End User grants to Sandvine the right to verify End User's use of the Cloud Software by either: (I) installing license manager software in End User's private network configured to allow the emailing of a monthly report detailing the scope of deployment and use of the Cloud Software, including the maximum number of Sites activated and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers at any particular time, or (II) allowing Sandvine to install license manager software in a network environment where Sandvine has direct access to End User's private network in order to generate a monthly report detailing the scope of deployment and use of the Cloud Software, including the maximum number of Sites activated and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers at any particular time. If End User's internal security practices prohibit such access to their private network, End User shall provide Sandvine, on a quarterly basis, with a written certification from an officer of End User certifying the

Version: 26-January-2021 PROPRIETARY

Page 4 of 17

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
maximum number of Site and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers that were active during the quarter on a month by month basis ("Self Reporting").
b. Invoicing. Based upon the results of the Monthly Verification, Sandvine shall be entitled to invoice End User quarterly for the license fees associated with the maximum number of Sites and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers (as applicable) that were activated at any particular time during the previous three (3) months ("Invoice Period"). The difference between the number of Sites and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers as set out in Sandvine's quotation and the number of activated Sites and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers as determined by the Monthly Verifications shall remain available for use by End User. If End User elects to utilize Self Reporting, Sandvine shall invoice End User for all Sites and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers in advance and payment is due thirty (30) days following the date of the invoice and such payment shall be non-refundable. If Sandvine is not able to determine the maximum number of Sites and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers that were activated at any particular time during the Invoice Period, Sandvine shall be entitled to invoice the End User the lesser of: (I) the license fees associated with the maximum number of Sites and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers that were activated at any particular time during the previous Invoice Period, and (II) an amount that is equal to the total remaining value for all Sites and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers in Sandvine's quotation. Any invoice issued under this paragraph will be subject to a reconciliation based upon the actual number of Sites and/or Provisioned Cloud Subscribers that were activated at any particular time during the Invoice Period. Once the actual numbers are determined in accordance with Section 4(ii)a. (Monthly Verification), Sandvine shall be entitled to invoice the End User for any incremental license fees arising as a result of the reconciliation on the next quarterly invoice.
5. License Conditions. The licenses set out in this Agreement are at all times subject to the following restrictions and any contravention of these restrictions shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement:

Page 10 of 17

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
operation of any Product or Software; (2) cancel or suspend any service Sandvine provides (directly or indirectly via Sandvine-authorized resellers) for the End User under any agreement including, without limitation, the provision of any cloud or network based services, support and maintenance services, any updates or upgrades, training and professional services; and (3) notify applicable officials, bodies or organizations (including, but not limited to, law enforcement, judicial, regulatory and/or governmental) and respond to and assist with enquiries from such official and bodies.

Sandvine reserves the right to not renew a Support and Maintenance Services agreement for Hardware and/or Software that has been subject to an end of life announcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Maintenance Release will be made obsolete and thus not a Supported Release as of the General Availability of the next Maintenance Release and the installation of a Maintenance Release does not extend the lifetime of the related LTS Release under Sandvine's end of life policy. Sandvine reserves the right to discontinue the manufacture or sale of, or otherwise render or treat as obsolete, any or all of the Products covered by this Agreement. Sandvine will provide a minimum of ninety (90) days advance notice (which may be by email, or via the Portal, or as otherwise reasonably determined by Sandvine), or the notice as required by law, prior to discontinuing any Hardware in accordance with Sandvine's end-of-life policy. Sandvine will also announce last time buy dates for Products to permit End User to purchase (while quantities last) the Product subject to the last time buy announcement. After the last time buy date passes and provided no new features are added to the last LTS Release compatible with the Hardware product and the Hardware product has not reached the end of life milestone date, Sandvine: (a) will make available signature updates for such Supported Release; and (b) advises the traffic classification may degrade for some applications after the last time buy date. Provided that the End User has purchased Support and Maintenance Services for the Product for the continuous period from its acquisition of the Product through to the date of discontinuation, Sandvine will continue to make available Support and Maintenance Services in respect of: (a) discontinued Hardware, for a period of three (3) years from the date of discontinuation; and (b) a discontinued Supported Release of Software, for a period of two (2) years from the date of General Availability.
(vi) Termination by Sandvine. If a third party brings a claim against Sandvine that the Products infringe on that third party's valid patents or copyrights, Sandvine may at its option and discretion: (A) replace or modify affected Products to make them non-infringing, (B) secure rights for the End User to continue using affected Products, or (C) if Sandvine, acting reasonably, determines that (A) and (B) are not commercially reasonable options, terminate any applicable End User licenses and provide a refund, upon the return of such Products to Sandvine, for (1) Hardware or perpetually-licensed Software, the amount received by Sandvine for the returned Products depreciated on a five-year, straight-line basis (calculated daily); and (2) for Software licensed on a term or subscription basis, any prepaid but unused amount received by Sandvine for the returned Products. If applicable, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Sandvine, any such refund shall be provided to the Sandvine-authorized reseller who originally paid Sandvine for the Product and it will be up to the End User to obtain a refund from the Sandvine-authorized reseller from whom the End User purchased the Product.

(viii) If Support and Maintenance Services are reinstated for an End User in respect of a Product after a period of non-enrollment (which is not applicable for Software that is licensed on a subscription basis where the Support and Maintenance Service fees are including in the license fee for the Software), all of the arrears of support and maintenance fees for the period of non-coverage through to the end of the reinstatement period shall be required to be paid to Sandvine.
(ix) If Support and Maintenance Services are not included as part of the license End User buys for fixed term period Software and the End User chooses not to: (a) purchase Support and Maintenance Services in respect of the Software during that fixed term period, or (b) renew the Support and Maintenance Services agreement in respect of the Software during that fixed term period, the End User shall be entitled to continue to use the last installed version of the Software and Sandvine has no obligation to provide any assistance, support, maintenance, upgrades or updates.

b. does not purchase Support and Maintenance Services in respect of the Software for a fixed term period, or if the fixed term period has expired, the End User shall be entitled to continue to use the last version of the Software installed by the End User.
The End User may choose to purchase Support and Maintenance Services for the installed version of the licensed Software up until Sandvine declares the end of support for the installed version of the licensed Software in order to receive Support and Maintenance Services in respect of the Software, however the End User will not be entitled to any new versions, upgrades or updates to the Software after Sandvine declares the end of support for the installed version of the licensed Software. After the expiry of any Support and Maintenance Services agreement for the installed version of the licensed Software, the End User may continue to use the installed version of the licensed Software and Sandvine has no obligation to provide any assistance, support, maintenance, upgrades or updates.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT You and Oracle acknowledge that neither Oracle nor Apple has any obligation under this Agreement to furnish technical support or updates for the Program.

INDEMNIFICATION

If a third party makes a claim against You that Your use of the Program as provided in this Agreement

infringes its intellectual property rights, Oracle, at its sole cost and expense, will defend You against the

claim and indemnify You from the damages, liabilities, costs and expenses awarded by the court to the

third party claiming infringement or the settlement agreed to by Oracle, if You do the following:



notify Oracle promptly in writing, not later than 30 days after You receive notice of the claim (or

sooner if required by applicable law);



give Oracle sole control of the defense and any settlement negotiations; and



give Oracle the information, authority, and assistance it needs to defend against or settle the

claim.

If Oracle believes or it is determined that the Program may have violated a third party's intellectual property rights, Oracle may choose to either modify the Program to be non-infringing (while substantially preserving its utility or functionality) or obtain a license to allow for continued use, or if these alternatives are not commercially reasonable, Oracle may end the license for, and require return of, the Program and refund any fees You may have paid for it. Oracle will not indemnify You if You alter the Program or use it outside the scope of use identified in the Program's user documentation or if You use a version of the Program which has been superseded, if the infringement claim could have been avoided by using an unaltered current version of the Program. Oracle will not indemnify You to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon any information, design, specification, instruction, software, data, or material not furnished by Oracle. Oracle will not indemnify You to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon the combination of the Program with any products or services not provided by Oracle. Oracle will not indemnify You for infringement caused by Your actions against any third party if the Program as delivered to You and used in accordance with the terms of this agreement would not otherwise infringe any third party intellectual property rights. You and Oracle acknowledge that Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement or discharge of any third party claim that the Program or Your possession and use thereof infringes that third party's intellectual property rights. This section provides Your exclusive remedy for any infringement claims or damages.

END OF AGREEMENT You may terminate this Agreement by destroying all copies of the Program. Your right to use the Program shall end immediately if You fail to comply with any of the terms set forth in this Agreement, or as otherwise set forth in the "License" section above, in which case You shall destroy all copies of the Program. Except as expressly set forth in the Associated Product Agreement, the terms and conditions governing the Associated Product Agreement are not affected by the termination of Your right to use the Program under this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement that by their nature continue shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES The relationship between You and Oracle is that of licensee/licensor.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT You agree that this Agreement is the complete agreement pertaining to the subject matter hereof (including references to information contained in a URL or referenced policy) and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or representations existing between You and Oracle with respect to such subject matter. You acknowledge that the terms of this Agreement (including the license for the Program) are separate from the terms governing the Associated Product, and that this Agreement does not include the grant of any right to use the Associated Product. If any term of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective. Oracle's failure to enforce any right or provisions in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such provision, or any other provision of this Agreement. If You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this Agreement and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigé que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rediges en anglais.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Both parties acknowledge and agree that (i) this Agreement is solely between Oracle and You, and that Apple is not a party to this Agreement; (ii) Oracle is solely responsible for the Program and the content thereof; and (iii) Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that, upon Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against You as a third party beneficiary hereof.

G. Reservation of Rights. RSA reserves all rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit in any way RSA's right to develop, use, license, create derivative works of, or otherwise exploit the Software, or to permit third parties to do so.
H. Audit. RSA (including its independent auditors) shall have the right to audit Customer's usage of the Products no more than once annually to confirm compliance with the terms of the Agreement and the Schedule or Quote at RSA's expense. RSA shall schedule any audit at least thirty (30) days in advance. Any such audit shall be performed during regular business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities. Should such audit indicate usage of Products in excess of that for which Customer has paid, in addition to any other rights RSA may have for breach of this Agreement and the Schedule or Quote, Customer shall promptly reconcile its account with RSA and pay the RSA invoice, if any, that results from such reconciliation.
I. Termination. RSA may terminate licenses for cause if Customer breaches the terms governing use of Software and fails to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of RSA's written notice thereof. Upon termination of a license, Customer shall cease all use and return or certify destruction of applicable Software (including copies) to RSA.
J. Other License Terms. If a particular Product or component is covered by its own license terms ("Separate License Terms"), typically in the form of a (i) "click-to-accept" agreement included as part of the installation and/or download process, or (ii) "shrinkwrap" agreement included in the packaging for the Product, or (iii) notice indicating that by installation and/or use thereofthe related license terms apply, then, in case of conflict with the terms of this Agreement, such Separate License Terms shall (a)

prevail with regard to Products or components for which RSA is not the licensor; and (b) not prevail with regard to a Product or component for which RSA is the licensor.
5. PRODUCT WARRANTY. A. Equipment. RSA warrants that Equipment, and Equipment upgrades installed into Equipment, when purchased from RSA and operated with normal usage and regular recommended service, shall be free from material defects in materials and workmanship, and perform substantially in accordance with Documentation provided for Equipment until the expiration of the warranty period. Unless otherwise noted on the Product Notice or RSA quote, the warranty coverage for the microcode, firmwareor operating system software that enables Equipment to perform as described in its Documentation shall be no less than that whichapplies to such Equipment. To the extent specified in the Product Notice, Support Services in the form of the Support Option notedon the Product Notice are included free of charge during the Equipment warranty period. In some cases, a Support Option upgradeduring the Equipment warranty period may be available separate purchase.
B. Software. RSA warrants that Software will substantially conform to the applicable Documentation for such Software and that any physical media provided by RSA will be free from manufacturing defects in materials and workmanship until the expiration of the warranty period. RSA does not warrant that the operation of Software shall be uninterrupted or error free, that all defects canbe corrected, or that Software meets Customer's requirements, except if expressly warranted by RSA in its quote. Support Servicesfor Software are available for separate purchase and the Support Options are identified at the Product Notice.
C. Duration. Unless otherwise stated on the RSA quote, the warranty period from RSA for Products shall be as set forth at the Product Notice. Equipment warranty commences upon Delivery. Software warranty commences upon Delivery of the media or the date Customer is notified of electronic availability, as applicable. Equipment upgrades are warranted from Delivery until the end of the warranty period for the Equipment into which such upgrades are installed. D. Customer Remedies.
i. Equipment. RSA's entire liability and Customer's exclusive remedies under the warranties described in this Section shall be for RSA, at its option, to remedy the non-compliance or to replace the affected Equipment, and if RSA is unable to effect such within a reasonable time, then RSA shall refund the amount paid by Customer for the affected Equipment as depreciated on a straight line basis over a five (5) year period, upon return of such Equipment to RSA. All replaced Equipment or portions thereof shall be returned to and become the property of RSA. If such replacement is not so returned, Customer shall pay RSA's then current spare parts price therefore. RSA shall have no liability hereunder after expiration of the applicable warranty period. ii. Software. If Customer discovers a non-conformity in the Software during the Warranty Period, then RSA's entire liability and Customer's exclusive remedy shall be as follows: Customer shall submit to RSA a written report describing the non- conformity in sufficient detail to permit RSA to reproduce such non-conformity. If RSA successfully reproduces the reported non-conformity and confirms that it is a non-conformity, then RSA shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at its option, to (1)correct the nonconformity, (2) provide a work around or software patch (a "Fix"), or (3) replace the RSA Software. If RSA determines that none of these alternatives is reasonably available, then, upon Customer's request, RSA shall refund any payments that Customer has made for the affected RSA Software and accept its return. This warranty applies only to the initial delivery of the RSA Software.
E. Exclusions. Warranty does not cover problems that arise from (i) accident or neglect of the Equipment by Customer or any third party; (ii) any third party items or services with which the Product is used or other causes beyond RSA's control; (iii) installation, operation or use not in accordance with RSA's instructions or the applicable Documentation; (iv) use in an environment, in a manner or for a purpose for which the Product was not designed; or (v) modification, alteration or repair by anyone other than RSA or its authorized representatives; or (vi) in case of Equipment only, causes not attributable to normal wear and tear (collectively, the "Excluded Claims"). RSA has no obligation whatsoever for Software installed or used beyond the licensed use, for Equipment which was moved from the Installation Site without RSA's consent or whose original identification marks have been altered or removed.
F. No Further Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WITH REGARD TO PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR ANY OTHER ITEMS OR MATTERS ARISING HEREUNDER, RSA (INCLUDING ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKES NO OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES,WRITTEN OR ORAL, AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES. INSOFAR AS PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITEDTO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY ARISING BY STATUTE, OPERATION OF LAW, COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. 6.

Customer acknowledges that products and services provided under the CSA are not designed to process, store, or be used in connection with Excluded Data. Customer is solely responsible for reviewing data that will be provided to or accessed by Suppliers to ensure that it does not contain Excluded Data. B. Indemnification Process. A party's duty to defend and indemnify under this section is contingent upon the party seeking indemnity: (i) sending prompt written notice of the matter to the party providing indemnity and taking reasonable steps to mitigate damages; (ii) granting to the party providing indemnity the sole right to control the defense and resolution of the matter; and (iii) cooperating with the party providing indemnity in the defense and resolution of the matter and in mitigating any damages. 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Limitations on Damages. The limitations, exclusions and disclaimers stated below apply to any and all disputes, claims, or controversies (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) related to or arising out of the CSA or any quote or Order ("Dispute"). The terms of this Section are agreed allocations of risk constituting part of the consideration for RSA's sale of products and services to Customer and will apply even if there is a failure of the essential purpose of any limited remedy, and regardless whether a party has been advised of the possibility of the liabilities.
A. (1). Limitation on Direct Damages. Except for Customer's obligations to pay for products and services, Customer's violation of the restrictions on use of products and services or RSA's or its Affiliates' intellectual property rights, or a party's indemnity obligation stated in the Section above titled "Indemnity", each party's total liability arising out of any Dispute or any matter under this CSA, is limited to the amount Customer paid to RSA during the twelve months before the date that the matter or Dispute arose for the product, services, or both that are the subject of the Dispute, but excluding amounts received as reimbursement of expenses or payment of taxes. A. (2). No Indirect Damages. Except for Customer's payment obligations and violation of RSA's or its Affiliates' intellectual property rights, neither RSA nor Customer has liability to the other for special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, incidental, or indirect damages, or for lost profits, loss of revenue, loss or corruption of data, or loss of use, or procurement of substitute products or services.
B. Regular Back-ups. Customer is solely responsible for its data. Customer must back up its data before RSA performs any remedial, upgrade, or other work on Customer's production systems. If applicable law prohibits exclusion of liability for lost data, then RSA will only be liable for the cost of the typical effort to recover the lost data from Customer's last available back-up.
C. Limitation Period. Except as stated in this Section, all claims must be made within the period specified by applicable law.If the law allows the parties to specify a shorter period for bringing claims, or the law does not provide a time at all, then claims must be made within twelve months after the cause of action accrues.
D. Suppliers and Affiliates. The foregoing limitations shall also apply in favor of RSA's Suppliers and Affiliates.
9. TRADE COMPLIANCE. Customer's purchase of licenses for Software and access to related technology ("Materials") are for its own use, not for resale, export, re-export, or transfer. Customer is subject to and responsible for compliance with the export control and economic sanctions laws of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions. Materials may not be used, sold, leased, exported, imported, re-exported, or transferred except with prior written authorization by RSA. or its Affiliates and in compliance with such laws, including, without limitation, export licensing requirements, end-user, end-use, and end-destination restrictions, and prohibitions on dealings with sanctioned individuals and entities, including but not limited to persons on the Office of Foreign Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List. Customer represents and warrants that it is not the subject or target of, and that Customer is not located ina country or territory (including without limitation, North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Crimea) that is the subject or target of, economic sanctions of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions. Customer understands and will comply with all applicable provisions of the U.S. Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) in Customer's receipt, use, transfer, modification, or disposal of Software. Customer acknowledges that any use, modification, or integration of the Software in or with defense articles or in the provision of defense services is not authorized by RSA, and that RSA will not provide warranty, repair, customer support, or other services in connection with such end uses. Customer certifies that any software, disk images, or other data provided to RSA in connection with the purchase of the Software will not contain technical data, software, or technology controlled by the ITAR or AECA, and that if Customer later

Confidential - 5 September 2020

returns the Software to RSA or grants RSA access to the Software, Customer will not include or otherwise make available to RSA any such technical data, software, or technology. Customer agrees to indemnify and hold RSA harmless for any liability, loss,damage, cost, expense, or penalty arising from Customer's non-compliance with the AECA, ITAR, or the provisions of this Section.
10. CONFIDENTIALITY. "Confidential Information" means any information that is marked "confidential" or "proprietary" or any other similar term or in relation to which its confidentiality should by its nature be inferred or, if disclosed orally, is identified as being confidential at the time of disclosure and, within two (2) weeks thereafter, is summarized, appropriately labeled and provided in tangible form. Confidential Information does not include information that is (i) rightfully in the receiving party's possession without prior obligation of confidentiality from the disclosing party; (ii) a matter of public knowledge; (iii) rightfully furnished to the receiving party by a third party without confidentiality restriction; or (iv) independently developed by the receiving party without reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information. Each party shall (a) use Confidential Information of the other party only for the purposes of exercising rights or performing obligations in connection with this Agreement or any purchase order hereunder; and (b) protect from disclosure to any third parties, by use of a standard of care equivalent to that as used by recipient to protect its own information of a similar nature and importance, and, no less than the use of reasonable care, any Confidential Information disclosed by the other party for a period commencing upon the date of disclosure until three (3) years thereafter, except with respect to (1) Customer data to which RSA may have access in connectionwith the provision of Services, which shall remain Confidential Information until one of the exceptions stated in the above definition of Confidential Information applies; and (2) Confidential Information that constitutes, contains or reveals, in whole or inpart, RSA proprietary rights, which shall not be disclosed by the receiving party at any time, and (3) Products, Software Releases,Evaluation Products, Training Materials and Documentation, which shall remain Confidential Information until one of the exceptions stated above applies. Customer may not disclose the results of any performance tests of the Software to any third partywithout RSA's prior written approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information (A) to its Affiliate for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights hereunder as long as such Affiliate complies with the foregoing; and (B) to the extent required by law (provided the receiving party has given the disclosing party prompt notice). Each party acknowledges that any breach of the provisions of this Section 10 would result in serious and irreparable injury to the non- breaching party for which the non-breaching party cannot be adequately compensated. Each party agrees, therefore, that, in addition to any other remedy that the non-breaching party may have, the non-breaching party is entitled to seek both temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages.
The parties do not intend to disclose to one another hereunder information that would be covered by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or similar privacy legislation within or outside of the United States. Accordingly, neither party shall disclose to the other hereunder any of the following information regarding either party's employees, customers, suppliers or other business partners: protected health information (as defined at 45 CFR 164.501), social security numbers, driver's license numbers, credit card numbers or similar government identity numbers or personal financial account numbers.
11. TERM AND TERMINATION. This Agreement takes effect on the Effective Date and continues until terminated for cause; provided that in such cases the breaching party is notified of the cause for termination and, in the event a remedy is possible, is first afforded thirty (30) days to remedy the cause for termination. Any provision that by its nature or context is intended to survive any termination or expiration, including but not limited to provisions relating to paymentof outstanding fees, confidentiality and liability, shall so survive. Upon any termination of this Agreement or Customer's license to use the Software, upon RSA's request, Customer shall promptly return to RSA, or destroy and certify in writing to RSA, that it has destroyed the original and all copies, in whole or in part, in any form, of the Software, Documentation, and any other Confidential Information disclosed by RSA under this Agreement. The termination of this Agreement shall not (a) discharge any payment obligations accrued as of the effective date of such termination, even if such obligations are payable after the termination date, or (b) entitle Customer to a refund of any amounts previously paid to RSA.
12. MISCELLANEOUS. A. References. Each party shall not, and shall not authorize or assist another to, originate, produce, issue or release any written publicity, news release, marketing collateral or other publication or public announcement, relating in any way to this Agreement, without the prior written approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,that RSA may identify Customer for reference purposes and use Customer's logo in its marketing material unless and until Customer expressly objects in writing.
B. Notices. Any notices hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be deemed given when delivered (i) in person, (ii) by overnight courier, upon written confirmation of receipt, (iii) by certified or registered mail, with proof of delivery, (iv) by facsimile transmission with confirmation of receipt, or (v) by email, with confirmation of receipt. Notices shall be sent to the address, facsimile number or email address set forth above, or at such other address, facsimile number or email address as provided to the other party in writing.
C. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and if Customer is purchasing directly from RSA, each quote, schedule and purchase order
(i) comprise the complete statement of the agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter thereof; and (ii) may be modified only in a writing with evidence of acceptance by both parties. All terms of any purchase order or similar document provided by Customer, including but not limited to any pre-printed terms thereon and any terms that are inconsistent or conflict with this Agreement and/or RSA quote or schedule, shall be null and void and of no legal force or effect, even if RSA does not expressly

object to such terms when accepting a purchase order or similar document provided by Customer. In case of any conflict between a schedule or quote and this Agreement, the schedule or quote shall control.
D. Force Majeure. Except for payment of fees, if a party's performance of its obligations is prevented or interfered with due to any force majeure event, including strikes, riots, insurrection, terrorism, fires, natural disasters, acts of God, war, governmental action, or any other cause which is beyond the reasonable control of such party ("Non-Performance Cause"), suchParty shall (i) promptly notify the other; and (ii) be excused from the performance of the affected obligations on a day-for-day basis, during the Force Majeure Event; (iii) use reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the Non-Performance Cause; and (iv) move to resume performance as soon as possible after the Non-Performance Cause is removed or ceases. E. Assignment. Customer shall not assign this Agreement or a purchase order or any right herein or delegate any performance without RSA's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. RSA may use RSA Affiliates or other sufficiently qualified subcontractors to provide Services to Customer, provided that RSA shall remain responsible to Customer for the performance thereof.
F. Governing Law.

G. Waiver. No waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any prior or subsequent default hereunder.
H. Independent Contractors. The parties shall act as independent contractors for all purposes under this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to constitute either party as an agent or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. Neither party shall be responsible for the acts or omissions of the other party, and neither party shall have authority to speak for, represent or obligate the other party in any way without the prior writtenapproval of the other party.
I. Partial Invalidity. If any part of this Agreement, a purchase order, SOW or an RSA quote is held unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected.

The limitations, exclusions and disclaimers stated below apply to any and all disputes, claims, or controversies (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) related to or arising out of the CSA or any quote or Order ("Dispute"). The terms of this Section are agreed allocations of risk constituting part of the consideration for RSA's sale of products and services to Customer and will apply regardless whether a party has been advised of the possibility of the liabilities. A. (1). Limitation on Direct Damages. Except for Customer's obligations to pay for products and services, Customer's violation of the restrictions on use of products and services or RSA's or its Affiliates' intellectual property rights, or a party's indemnity obligation stated in the Section above titled "Indemnity", and any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by the applicable law, each party's total liability arising out of any Dispute or any matter under this CSA, is limitedto the amount Customer paid to RSA during the twelve months before the date that the matter or Dispute arose for the product,services, or both that are the subject of the Dispute, but excluding amounts received as reimbursement of expenses or paymentof taxes.

Except for Customer's payment obligations and violation of RSA's or its Affiliates' intellectual property rights, neither RSA nor Customer has liability to the other for special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, incidental, or indirect damages, or for lost profits, loss of revenue, loss or corruption of data, or loss of use, or procurement of substitute products or services. B. Regular Back-ups. Customer is solely responsible for its data. Customer must back up its data before RSA performs any remedial, upgrade, or other work on Customer's production systems. If applicable law prohibits exclusion of liability for lost data, then RSA will only be liable for the cost of the typical effort to recover the lost data from Customer's last availablebackup. C. Limitation Period. Except as stated in this Section, all claims must be made within the period specified by applicable law. If the law allows the parties to specify a shorter period for bringing claims, or the law does not provide a time at all, then claims must be made within twelve months after the cause of action accrues. D. Suppliers and Affiliates. The foregoing limitations shall also apply in favor of RSA's Suppliers and Affiliates.

Equipment upgrades are warranted in the same manner as the Equipment in which the upgrades are installed from Delivery of the upgrade until the end of the warranty period for the Equipment into which the upgrades are installed.
3.2 Section 5.D, Customer Remedies shall be replaced in its entirety with:
(i) Equipment and Software Media Warranty Remedies. In case of a defect notified to RSA, RSA shall, at its option, either remedy the defect or replace the affected Product. If RSA is unable to effect such within a reasonable time and Customer has notified RSA in writing of the breach with the request to remedy the defect within a reasonable time period to no avail (whereby Customer shall grant to RSA a reasonable number of attempts (but no less than three) to cure the defect), then Customer has the right to reduce the remuneration or to rescind the purchase order for the Product concerned. Customer is entitled to the foregoing rights also without setting a grace period if RSA has seriously and definitely refused to cure a defect. If Customer rescinds the purchase order, RSA shall refund the amount paid by Customer for the Product concerned as depreciated on a straight-line basis over a five (5) year period, upon return of such Product to RSA. All replaced Products or portions thereof shall be returned to and be-come the property of RSA.

RSA warrants to Customer that the Software will, substantially conform to the applicable Documentation, provided that the Software: (a) has been properly installed and used at all times in accordance with the applicable Documentation; and (b) has not been modified or added to by persons other than RSA or its authorized representative.
Except for cases of gross negligence and willful misconduct, in which statutory provisions apply, and unless a different warranty period has been agreed in a particular case, claims for defects in Products shall become time-barred upon expiration of the warranty period set forth in the Product Notice. To the extent the foregoing does not lead to a different period, warranty period shall be one (1) year. Software warranty commences upon Delivery or notice of availability for electronic download.
In case of a defect notified to RSA, RSA shall, at its option, either remedy the defect or replace the affected Product. If RSA is unable to effect such within a reasonable time and Customer has notified RSA in writing of the breach with the request to remedy the defect within a reasonable time period to no avail (whereby Customer shall grant to RSA a reasonable number of attempts (but no less than three) to cure the defect), then Customer has the right to reduce the remuneration or to rescind the purchase order for the Product concerned. Customer is entitled to the foregoing rights also without setting a grace period if RSA has seriously and definitely refused to cure a defect.
If Customer rescinds the purchase order, RSA shall refund the amount paid by Customer for the Product concerned as depreciated on a straight line basis over a five (5) year period, upon return of such Product to RSA.
(iii) Lease Contracts. The provisions on statutory warranty for lease contracts (sec. 536 et seq German Civil Code (BGB)) shall not apply.

6. Section 8 Limitation of liability: shall be replaced in its entirety with:
8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

Unrestricted liability. In case of death or personal injury, in case of EMC's gross negligence or willful misconduct, and in case of claims under the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz), RSA shall be liable to Customer according to statutory law.

(ii) Unless a differing liability cap is expressly agreed otherwise, the typical foreseeable damages shall, for each damaging event, not exceed the total price paid by Customer to RSA for the Products and Services (calculated on an annual basis in case of ongoing Services to be provided for a period of more than one year) in relation to which such claim arises, but in any event not less than 100.000,00 EUR and not more than 1.000.000,00 EUR.
(iii) RSA shall be liable to Customer only if RSA has breached a material contractual obligation (i. e. an obligation the performance of which is essential to allow the implementation of the agreement, and the compliance with which Customer usually may rely on). (iv) RSA shall not be liable for any consequential or indirect damages to the extent such damages are untypical or unforeseeable. C. Guarantees. RSA does not give a guarantee in relation to Products or Services (Beschaffenheitsgarantie) that would entail an unlimited liability of RSA or a liability regardless of negligence or fault pursuant to the German Civil Code, except if an unlimited liability and/or liability regardless of negligence or fault has been expressly agreed in writing. The mere use of terms like "to guarantee", "to ensure" or similar wording shall not be considered sufficient to establish such liability, but a binding contractual commitment of RSA that is subject to the agreed limitation of liability. D. Regular Back-ups. As part of its obligation to mitigate damages, Customer shall take reasonable data back-up measures. In particular, Customer shall provide for a daily back-up process and back-up the relevant data before RSA performs any remedial, upgrade or other works on Customer's production systems.

Except for claims relating to cases of unrestricted liability set forth in section A above ("Restricted Liability") the following applies: All claims for damages based on defects of Products or Services shall be time-barred 12 months after delivery, except if the parties have agreed on a shorter warranty period. The limitation period for all other claims for damages shall be eighteen (18) months after the cause of action accrues, unless statutory law provides for a shorter limitation period.
F. Suppliers. The foregoing limitations shall also apply in favor of RSA's employees and Suppliers.

Receiving Party shall give prompt written notice to Disclosing Party of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Disclosing Party's Confidential Information. Receiving Party will take all reasonable measures to ensure that no unauthorized person shall have access to the Confidential Information and that all authorized parties having access refrain from making any unauthorized disclosure in violation of this EULA. Receiving Party agrees to assist Disclosing Party in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure by Receiving Party or any of its employees or independent contractors of Disclosing Party's Confidential Information. Receiving Party shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations protecting the Confidential Information and privacy rights of the Disclosing Party, its Licensees and suppliers, and shall be responsible for any failure by its authorized parties to so comply.
d. The obligations of Receiving Party under this Section 8 with respect to any portion of the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party, shall not apply to such portion that Receiving Party can demonstrate by competent evidence: (i) was in the public domain at or subsequent to the time such portion was communicated to Receiving Party by Disclosing Party, through no fault of Receiving Party; or (ii) was known by the Receiving Party prior to its receipt of the Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party; or (iii) is furnished by a third party to the Receiving Party as a matter of right and without restriction on disclosure; or (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of, or reference to any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or (v) is agreed in writing by the parties not to be considered Confidential Information.

Each party shall defend and indemnify the other against any third-party claim for personal bodily injury,

including death, to the extent the injury has been caused by the indemnifying party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

b.

Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold Thales and its officers, directors, employees and agents

harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements,

interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including professional fees and reasonable

c.

The obligation of each party to indemnify the other pursuant to this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or

termination of this Agreement.

11) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION

a.

Subject to Section 12 (Limitation of Liability), Thales will defend at its own expense, or at its option, settle any

action brought by a third party against Licensee to the extent that it is based upon a claim that a Thales provided Product

infringes a valid Canada, United States, European Union, Hong Kong or United Kingdom patent or copyright that are in

effect as of the Effective Date, or misappropriates a third party's trade secret ("IP Claim"). Subject to Section 12 (Limitation

of Liability), Thales will pay direct costs and direct monetary damages finally awarded against Licensee with respect to any

such IP Claim, which are directly and solely attributable to such IP claim (the "IP Indemnity").

b.

The IP Indemnity is subject to and limited by: (i) Licensee providing prompt notification in writing to Thales of

any such action; (ii) Thales having sole control of the defense and all negotiations for settlement of such action; (iii)

Licensee providing all available information, reasonable assistance and authority to enable Thales to defend, negotiate

and settle such action; and (iv) Licensee not making any admission or taking any other action that could prejudice the

defense or settlement of the IP Claim.

c.

Sole and exclusive remedy. Should such Products become, or in Thales' opinion, be likely to become the subject

of an IP Claim or the use thereof become restricted by a court awarded injunction, Thales shall, at Thales' sole option and

expense, either: (i) procure for Licensee the right to continue using such Products by license or release from claim of

violation, infringement or misappropriation; (ii) modify such Products so that they are functionally equivalent but are no

longer subject to an IP Claim;

(iii) replace the Product with equally suitable substitute Product free from the IP Claim. If the foregoing options are not

practical or available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, as determined by Thales in its sole judgment,

Thales may require the return of the Products and upon such return refund to Licensee the purchase price for the

impacted Product based on a five (5) year straight line depreciation schedule, with such depreciation schedule to be

deemed to have commenced on the applicable Product delivery date.

d.

Exceptions to Thales' indemnity. Thales shall have no liability to the Licensee under this IP Indemnity with respect

to any IP Claim which is based upon or arises from: (i) Thales' compliance with any design, technical information,

instructions or specifications furnished by the Licensee; (ii) the combination or utilization of Products furnished hereunder

with products or services not provided by Thales, if the infringement would not have occurred in the absence of such

combination; (iii) the modification of the Products furnished hereunder other than by Thales or its agents, servants or

subcontractors; or (iv) the use of the Products contrary to the Documentation; (iv) the use of the Products in a country

other than the country of ultimate destination of the Product; (v) the issuance, operation or use of the Products for the

benefit of any third party other than the Licensee; and (vi) Licensee's continuing the allegedly infringing activity or using

allegedly infringing versions of the Products, or any portion or component thereof, after (x) being notified thereof, and (y)

being provided at no cost to Licensee, modifications to the Product that would have avoided the alleged infringement

without significant loss of performance, functionality, or compatibility.

e.

ITS LICENSORS AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF LICENSEE WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF

End-User may not re-license the Software. End-User covenants and agrees that the Software will only be used in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

(b) End-User shall have no right to change, copy, alter, amend, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, publish, disclose, display or make available, in whole or in part, or otherwise use the Software in any manner whatsoever other than the use specified in this Agreement, and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure End-Userâs employees comply with these provisions.

(c) PrintFleet or its licensors shall retain all right, title, copyright, trade secrets, patents, trade-marks and other proprietary and intellectual property rights in the Software. End-User does not acquire any rights, express or implied, in the Software, other than those specified in this Agreement. End-User shall not remove any proprietary, copyright, patent, trade-mark, design right, trade secret or any other proprietary rights legends from the Software.

(d) Third-Party Software may be embedded in or delivered with the Software licensed under this Agreement. End-User shall be limited to use of the Software licensed under this Agreement. End-Userâs right to use any Third-Party Software shall be limited to the use necessary to implement the Software licensed. End-User shall have no right to use such Third-Party Software other than as necessary for the licensed ordinary use of the Software and grants PrintFleetâs licensors the right to protect their interests under this Agreement and agrees that such licensors are benefited by the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) End-User will take appropriate steps, both before installation and at all times thereafter, to copy and protect End-Userâs own data and programs that may be lost, harmed or destroyed and to protect End-Userâs equipment from any damage. End-User, and End-User alone, will be responsible for reconstruction, replacement, repair or recreation of lost programs, data or equipment in the event of hardware, software or Software failure. PrintFleet and Partner shall, under no circumstances, be responsible for any such losses or damages.


3. Warranty and Disclaimer

(a) PrintFleet warrants to End-User for a period of thirty (30) days from the Commencement Date that the diskettes, CD-ROMs or other media provided to End-User will, under normal use, be free from defects in materials and workmanship. The entire liability of PrintFleet and Partners shall be limited to replacement of such diskettes, CD-ROMs or other media.

(b) End-User hereby expressly agrees and acknowledges that, except as provided in this Agreement, the Software is provided "as is" and PrintFleet, its employees, Partners and agents make no representations or warranties or covenants, express or implied, in respect of the Software or any work or services performed by PrintFleet or its employees, Partners or agents, including without limitation, statutory or implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, satisfactory quality, title, non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose, all of which are expressly disclaimed and excluded, provided that this disclaimer and exclusion is limited so as not to apply in any jurisdiction in relation to a warranty which is legally incapable of exclusion in said jurisdiction.

(c) PrintFleet and Partner do not warrant, guarantee or represent to End-User that the Software will meet End-Userâs requirements, that the installation and operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free or that Software defects will be corrected.



4. Indemnification

PrintFleet will defend and indemnify End-User against a claim that the Software used within the scope of this Agreement infringes upon any intellectual property right of a third party provided that: (a) End-User notifies PrintFleet in writing within thirty (30) days of the claim; (b) PrintFleet has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (c) End-User provides PrintFleet with the assistance, information and authority necessary to perform PrintFleetâs obligations under this Section. PrintFleet shall have no liability for any claim of infringement based on the combination, operation or use of the Software furnished under this Agreement with software, hardware or other materials not furnished by PrintFleet if such infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Software without such software, hardware or other materials. In the event the Software is legally held or is believed by PrintFleet to infringe, PrintFleet shall have the option, at its expense, to: (a) modify the Software to be non-infringing; (b) obtain for End-User a license to continue using the Software; or (c) terminate the license for the Software and reimburse the license fee therefor on the basis of a five-year straight-line amortization.

5. Limitation of Liability

Except as provided in section 4, notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall PrintFleet (or its Partners, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors) be liable to End-User or any third party claiming through End-User for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages howsoever caused (including damages for loss of profits, business interruption, loss of business information, increased costs of operation, litigation costs and the like) whether based upon a claim or action in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, in connection with the supply, use or performance of the Software, regardless of whether PrintFleet has been advised of the possibility of such damages or such damage was reasonably foreseeable.

Because some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of the foregoing warranties or liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to End-User. In the event applicable provincial, state, federal or other law does not allow the complete exclusion or limitation of liability of claims and damages as set forth in this Agreement, the liability of PrintFleet, its employees, Partners and agents is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.


6. Assignment

PrintFleet may assign its rights hereunder without the consent of or notice to End-User. Except in the event of a merger or amalgamation of End-User or the acquisition of all or substantially all of End-Userâs assets by a third party, End-User shall not transfer, assign, sub-license or pledge its rights or obligations hereunder without the written consent of PrintFleet, said consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

3. RESERVED RIGHTS. You acknowledge and agree that the Software is a proprietary product of Bentley or its suppliers, distributors and unrelated third parties ("Suppliers") protected by copyright and other applicable intellectual property laws and treaty provisions. You further acknowledge and agree that the entire right, title and interest in and to the Software including associated intellectual property rights, shall remain with Bentley or its Suppliers. This license grant may be made by Bentley on behalf of Suppliers as third party beneficiaries of the license rights provided herein.

as set forth in this EULA.
12. TIME CLOCKS. Bentley's default licensing term is perpetual unless otherwise specifically identified for the Software licensed. If you have licensed the Software subject to this EULA for a term shorter than a perpetual license, you acknowledge that the Software may be delivered to you with embedded Time Clocks. You agree that Time Clocks are not considered a defect of the Software and you release Bentley from any and all claims, however characterized, arising from or related to Time Clocks or their operation.
13. ANTI-PIRACY. As part of legal efforts to combat criminal software piracy, the Software may include a security mechanism that can detect the installation or use of illegal copies of the Software and collect and transmit data about those illegal copies. Data collected will not include any customer data created with the Software. By using the Software, you consent to such detection and collection of data, as well as its transmission and use if an illegal copy is detected. If you are using an illegal copy of our software and do not consent to the collection and transmission of such data (including to the United States), cease using the illegal version and contact Bentley to obtain a legally licensed copy.

You may also make a one-time transfer of a CAL to another of your Users or Devices located at the same Site. In order to accomplish these transfers you may need to contact Bentley. External. You may not transfer the Software and license granted under this EULA, or a CAL, to a third party without Bentley's prior written consent. If such consent is obtained, you may permanently transfer the Software and the license granted under this EULA, or the CAL, provided you transfer the Software and all and media to such third party, and you do not retain any copies. The recipient of such transfer must agree to all terms and conditions of the EULA. Any purported sublicense, assignment, transfer or encumbrance is void without Bentley's prior consent.
15. UPGRADES. You may not use any Software identified as an upgrade unless you are properly licensed to use Software which Bentley has identified as being eligible for an upgrade. After installing an upgrade, you may use the original Software product that was eligible for an upgrade provided that at any one time you use only the upgraded Software or the prior Software version subject to the upgrade.

16. NO EXTENSION OF CAPABILITIES. You may develop your own applications that interoperate or integrate with the Software. Bentley prices its Software, among other factors, based on capabilities that we expose to you. You may not extend the Software to enable or unlock capabilities of the Software not specifically identified by Bentley as forming part of the specified end user functionality.
17. SEPARATION OF COMPONENTS. The Software is licensed as a single product. Component parts of the Software may not be separated and installed or used on multiple Devices.

19. NO AUTOMATED USE. A license for the Software may not be shared or used concurrently on different Devices, nor shared or used to support multiple User or operational requests as indicated above. As a result, you may not use the Software in an automated, unattended, non-interactive server application or component (including ASP) where: (i) multiple User requests from different Users are queued for processing; or (ii) multiple requests from one User are queued for processing but acting against content created or edited by other Users. Examples which would violate this Section 18 include but are not limited to use as a plot server, file translator, print server or other applications using or employing similar methods.
20. LIMITED WARRANTY. Except for Software which is identified as nocharge, free, demo, evaluation, BDN, Beta, Technology Preview, or NFR, which is provided to you "AS-IS" and specifically without warranty of any kind, for sixty (60) days from the date of first installation (the "Warranty Period"), Bentley warrants that (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the functional specifications in the documentation which accompanies the Software; and (ii) the media on which the Software is distributed meets generally accepted industry standards. It is understood that neither Bentley nor its Suppliers are responsible for your use of the Software or the results from such use. It is further understood that there may be errors or omissions in the information contained in the Software, that the information contained in the Software may not be current or complete and that defects in hardware or software may prevent you from gaining access to the Software. This limited warranty is offered by Bentley alone, and is not extended to any software code that may be contributed to the Software by our Suppliers. Any supplements or updates to the Software (including but not limited to fixes, work in progress builds, or subsequent updates) provided to you after the expiration of the Limited Warranty period above are not covered by any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory.
21. DISCLAIMER. THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY STATES THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR BENTLEY'S OR ITS SUPPLIER'S BREACH OF WARRANTY. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED

WARRANTY AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BENTLEY AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION, BENTLEY AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, FOR ITSELF AND FOR ALL SUPPLIERS, EITHER STATUTORY, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF GOOD TITLE, WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC RIGHTS; YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY AMONG JURISDICTIONS.

22. HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. The Software is not fault tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Software could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). Accordingly, Bentley and its Suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities.
23. END USER REMEDIES. If a defect in the Software appears that constitutes a breach of the above Limited Warranty, Bentley shall, at its sole option, repair the Software, refund the price you paid for the Software or replace the defective item(s), provided that: (i) you notify Bentley of the defect during the Warranty Period; (ii) the Software is not modified, changed, or altered by anyone other than Bentley, unless authorized by Bentley in writing; (iii) your computer equipment is in good operating order and the Software is installed in an officially supported environment; and (iv) the non-conformity is not caused by a third party or by you, your agents, employees or contractors. Repaired, corrected, or replaced Software shall be covered by this limited warranty for the period remaining under the warranty covered by the original Software, or if longer, for thirty (30) days after the date: (a) of installation by you of the repaired or replaced Software, or (b) Bentley advised you how to operate the Software so as to achieve the functionality described in the documentation. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR BREACH BY BENTLEY OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY MADE IN THIS EULA.
24. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Regardless of whether any remedy set forth herein fails of its essential purpose by law, in no event will Bentley or its Suppliers be liable for indirect, special, incidental, economic or consequential damages, regardless of the nature of the claim, including without limitation lost profits, costs of delay, interruption of business, loss of use, costs of lost or damaged data or documentation or liabilities to third parties arising from any source, even if Bentley has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall the liability of Bentley or its Suppliers exceed the amount paid by you (in the currency used to purchase) for the Software. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS EULA ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN BENTLEY AND YOU. BENTLEY'S PRICING REFLECTS THIS ALLOCATION OF RISK AND THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SPECIFIED HEREIN.
25. STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS. Nothing in this EULA is meant to contravene statutory rights that consumers may have pursuant to local law.
26. SANCTIONS AND EXPORT CONTROLS. The Software is subject to U.S. sanctions and export control laws, regulations and requirements, in addition to sanctions and export control laws, regulations and

requirements of other agencies or authorities based outside of the United States (collectively referred to as "Sanctions and Export Controls"). Regardless of any disclosure made by you to Bentley of an ultimate destination of the Software, you must not export, re-export or transfer, whether directly or indirectly, the Software, or any portion thereof, or any system containing such Software or portion thereof, to anyone without first complying strictly and fully with all Sanctions and Export Controls that may be imposed on the Software and/or the export, re-export or transfer, direct or indirect, of the Software, and transactions related thereto.

Article 2: Terms Applicable to Server Software
This Article details the installation, use and licensing of Server Software and associated CALs as well as External Connector licenses.
1. CERTAIN ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS.
1.1. "Client Software" means software that allows a Device to access or utilize Server Software (and, also where applicable to utilize certain aspects of the Software when disconnected from the Server).
1.2. "External Connector" means a separately licensable module for specific Server Software which authorizes use of the Server Software by External Users.
1.3. "Per Processor" is a Server Software licensing mode where you are licensed to utilize the Server Software on one or more physical or virtual processors within a designated Server.
1.4. "Per Server" is a Server Software licensing mode where you are licensed to utilize the Server Software on all processors physically contained within the designated Server.
1.5. "Per User" or "Per Device" are licensing modes that require you to license a separate CAL for each unique User or Device respectively that accesses or utilizes the Server Software.
1.6. "Server" means any one of your computers that can run Server Software.
1.7. "Server Software" means Software that provides services or functionality to your Server(s).

1.8. "Server/CAL" is a licensing mode where the maximum number of Users (or Devices, if applicable) which may access or utilize the Server Software at a given interval is less than or equal to the number of CALs that you have acquired and designated for use exclusively with that Server Software.
2. LICENSING MODES. 2.1. Servers. Bentley licenses Server Software on a Server/CAL basis with either Device or User CALs and/or on a Per Processor basis. Some Server Software may be eligible for External Connector licensing. Server Software may be limited, even in Server/CAL licensing mode, as to the total number of Devices and/or Users that may access a designated Server Product. Unless explicitly specified in the documentation accompanying the Server Software, the default licensing mode for all Server Software is Server/CAL with User CALs.
2.2. CALs. CALs are licensed by Bentley on a per Server, per Device or per User basis. A User CAL permits one User (using any Device) to access or use the Server Software. A Device CAL permits one Device to access or use the Server Software. Special Note Applicable to CAL Licensing: If you have covered the CALs and Server Software subject to this EULA pursuant to a valid SELECT Agreement with Bentley then you may be entitled to additional and incremental licensing benefits to those set forth in this EULA by virtue of that relationship. In the event your SELECT Agreement with Bentley terminates or you otherwise elect to remove CALs and/or their associated Server Software from coverage pursuant to a SELECT Agreement with Bentley then you will lose those incremental benefits, and your license rights will only be as set forth in this EULA.
2.3. External Connectors. Certain Server Products may be licensed to support External Users by virtue of an External Connector license.
3. GRANT OF LICENSE FOR SOFTWARE IN SERVER/CAL MODE. As and for so long as you comply with all the terms of this EULA, Bentley grants you the following rights:
3.1. Installation and Use. (a) Server Software. You may install and use one copy of the Server Software for Production Use on a single Server in the country where the Server Software was first obtained. You may also use the documentation that accompanies the Server Software for internal, non-commercial reference purposes only. (b) Client Software. You may install and use the Client Software on the aggregate total number of Devices to which you have dedicated a CAL for such usage.
(c) CALs. A separate CAL is required for each User or Device that accesses or uses Server Software on any of your Servers. A CAL grants a User (using any Device) or a Device the right to access or otherwise utilize the Server Software you have deployed on your Server. The maximum number of Users or Devices that may access or use Server Software installed on a particular Server at

a given interval equals the number of CALs (of either type) that you acquire and designate for use exclusively with that Server. CALs cannot be pooled among internal Users or Devices and are tied to one Server Software installation.
(d) Passive Fail-Over Server. If the Server Software is used in a clustered environment, you may use the Server Software on a temporary basis on a Server that is employed only and exclusively for fail-over support.
4. GRANT OF LICENSE FOR SERVER SOFTWARE IN PER SERVER MODE. As and for so long as you comply with all of the terms of this EULA, Bentley grants you the following rights:
4.1. Installation and Use (a) Server Software. You may install and use one copy of the Server Software for Production Use on a single Server in the country where the Server Software was first obtained. You may also use the documentation that accompanies the Server Software for internal, non-commercial reference purposes only. In Per Server licensing mode, the Bentley default is that you may use the Server Software on all processors physically contained within that one Server. If the Server Software is licensed in Per Processor mode, you may only use the Software on the authorized and licensed number of processors (physical or virtual) within that Server.
(b) Client Software. In Per Server licensing mode, unless Bentley licenses the Server Software with a limitation on the maximum number of Devices or Users that may access it, you may install the Client Software on any Device in support of any number of Users so long as the Client Software is being used only in conjunction with the Server Software.
(c) CALs. In Per Server licensing mode, unless Bentley licenses the Server Software with a limitation on the maximum number of Users or Devices that may access it, an unlimited number of Users or Devices may access and use the Server Software. CALs are not required for individual Users or Devices in the Per Server licensing mode.
(d) Passive Fail-Over Server. If the Server Software is used in a clustered environment, you may use the Server Software on a temporary basis on a Server that is employed only and exclusively for fail-over support.
5. GRANT OF LICENSE FOR EXTERNAL CONNECTOR LICENSES. As and for so long as you comply with all of the terms of this EULA, Bentley grants you the following rights:
5.1. Installation and Use (a) External Connector License. You may install and use one copy of the External Connector on one Device and connect that Device to the designated Server Software whether or not located at the same Site, but always within the same country as the Server Software installation.

(b) External Users. The default licensing mode for an External Connector authorizes you, for each External Connector license that you acquire, to permit any number of External Users to access or use a single copy of the designated Server Software for which the External Connector License has been obtained without the need for you to acquire a CAL for each External User. If any User does not clearly qualify as an External User then you will need to properly license such use and access by the User of the Server Software by a method other than via the External Connector. Certain External Connector licenses only authorize a limited number of External Users to connect via that External Connector, please check your Product documentation and License Key for specific details, limitations and qualifications.
(c) Passive Fail-Over External Connector. If the External Connector is installed on a Device used in a clustered environment, you may use the External Connector on a temporary basis on a Server or Device that is employed only and exclusively for fail-over support.
Article 3 ­ Terms Applicable to Test Software
THIS EULA, TOGETHER WITH ANY APPLICABLE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT APPEARING OR REFERENCED ON OR IN THE FILES DELIVERED DURING INSTALLATION REPRESENT THE ENTIRE SET OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS GOVERNING YOUR USE OF THE TEST SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION, AND SUPERSEDE ANY OTHER PRIOR PROPOSAL, REPRESENTATION, OR UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
1. Limited Rights For Testing Only.
(a) The Test Software has been designed and developed by Bentley, either alone or together with other third parties, and this license is made on behalf of all parties who contributed to the Test Software and Documentation. Subject to the terms and provisions set forth, Evaluator is willing to accept delivery of the Test Software for the purpose of using and evaluating the same. Bentley is willing to permit the Evaluator to use and to evaluate the Test Software under the terms and conditions of this EULA in order to obtain Evaluator information to such Test Software which may be helpful to Bentley in making any improvements, enhancements or modifications with respect thereto. The Test Software may be used only on a single computer owned, leased or otherwise controlled by you. You may not use the Test Software on any other platform, including, but not limited to, servers, except as expressly provided herein. The Test Software is "in use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk, CD-ROM or other storage

device) of that computer. If the Test Software is designed to provide services or functionality to servers, the Test Software shall be used on a single server owned, leased or otherwise controlled by Evaluator.
(b) Upon your acceptance of the Agreement by clicking "I accept" or by downloading the Test Software, Bentley does hereby grant Evaluator at no charge a non-exclusive, non- transferable right to use the Test Software for evaluation purposes only. This right shall terminate on the date Bentley determines in its sole discretion which Bentley no longer has a need for Evaluator information from the Evaluator regarding the Test Software; or Bentley has learned that the terms of this EULA have been breached by Evaluator.
2. Evaluation and Reports. Evaluator shall provide Bentley with reports concerning its opinion and evaluation of the Test Software. Evaluator shall consult with representatives of Bentley from time-to-time concerning the performance of the Test Software. Evaluator agrees that right, title and interest to any reports, feedback or suggestions relating to the Test Software or any inventions relating to an improvement, modification or enhancement of the Test Software conceived in, or made as a result of, Evaluator's performance of this EULA shall become the exclusive property of Bentley and that Bentley may disclose and use such information for any purposes whatsoever, entirely without obligation of any kind to Evaluator.
3. Confidential and Proprietary Information and Data.
(a) Evaluator acknowledges that the Test Software consists of software which is proprietary and confidential to Bentley or its licensors; and all rights, title and interest therein or thereto, including, without limitation, all patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets are proprietary and confidential to Bentley or its licensors and shall remain vested therein. Therefore, Evaluator shall not disclose, directly or indirectly, or take any other action which would result in the unauthorized disclosure of any confidential or proprietary data whatsoever, including, but not limited to, reproduction of data furnished to Evaluator by Bentley.
(b) The release of confidential information to Evaluator does not constitute a commercialization of the Test Software, but rather is a release for testing purposes ONLY. Evaluator shall not disclose to any third party the terms of this EULA nor the results of any Evaluator evaluation hereunder except with the written consent of Bentley. Evaluator shall, upon Bentley's request, certify in writing as to the return or destruction of all such confidential information.
(c) For purposes of this EULA, "Confidential and Proprietary Information" shall include, but not be limited to, the Test Software, including its functionality, performance, business purpose, specifications, Documentation, and the like, test results obtained by

Evaluator through use of the Test Software, any material data relating to use of the Test Software by Evaluator, including, but not limited to defects, deficiencies, errors, omissions, work- arounds, features, enhancements, updates, upgrades, and other information typically relating to unreleased version(s) of computer programs, and any and all information, either written or oral, relating to the Test Software, including plans, business and financial information, which may, from time-to-time, be disclosed by Bentley to Evaluator during the term of this EULA. It is understood by both parties that ANY information provided by Bentley during the term to Evaluator relating to the Test Software is Bentley's Confidential and Proprietary Information.
(d) The parties shall use such Confidential and Proprietary Information only for the purpose set forth in Section 1 above. Evaluator shall make no other use of the Confidential and Proprietary Information, in whole or in part, without the specific prior written consent of Bentley. Accordingly, Evaluator agrees not to make any commercial use of Confidential and Proprietary Information, and Evaluator shall not translate, copy, disassemble, reverse engineer, or decompile any Test Software, nor shall Evaluator make copies or translations of any Documentation. Furthermore, Evaluator will not make any pre-release reports or give pre-release interviews concerning the Test Software or the Confidential and Proprietary Information without Bentley's prior written consent.
(e) Evaluator shall maintain Bentley's Confidential and Proprietary Information in strict confidence, shall limit internal disclosure of Confidential and Proprietary Information to employees having a legitimate need to know, and shall exercise the same degree of care in protecting Bentley's Confidential and Proprietary Information as it exercises in protecting its own confidential and proprietary information. Evaluator may make copies of the Test Software only to the extent necessary for the purpose of this EULA, provided that Evaluator shall also reproduce and include Bentley's trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual property rights notices on each such copy and include the legend "Test Product­Do Not Copy or Distribute."
(f) Any other related materials supplied by Bentley, including Documentation, may not be reproduced in any manner by Evaluator. The original and all copies of Confidential and Proprietary Information shall remain the property of Bentley and shall be returned to Bentley upon demand.
4. Disclaimer of Warranty.
(a) Evaluator acknowledges that the Test Software has not been completely tested and will contain defects or deficiencies which cannot or may not be corrected. Evaluator further acknowledges that use of the Test Software may involve the transmission, upload, download, translation or transfer of its data to a server or computer

platform outside of Evaluator's control, and some errors in the data may occur while transferring, transmitting or translating data while using the Test Software. Bentley cautions Evaluator to determine for itself the suitability of the use of the Test Software for any purpose. Bentley further cautions Evaluator not to use the Test Software in a production environment.

(b) Evaluator acknowledges that Bentley has no express or implied obligation to announce or to introduce the Test Software or any similar or compatible product. Evaluator acknowledges that all use, testing, research and development performed by it pursuant to this AGREEMENT are done entirely at its own risk. ACCORDINGLY, BENTLEY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE TEST SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MECHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

(c) EVALUATOR ACCEPTS THE TEST SOFTWARE IN "AS-IS"

CONDITION, AND BENTLEY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY

DIRECT,

INDIRECT,

INCIDENTAL,

SPECIAL,

CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, REGARDLESS

OF THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM, INCLUDING WITHOUT

LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, ANY FAILURE

OF DELIVERY, COSTS OF LOST OR DAMAGED DATA OR

DOCUMENTATION OR LIABILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES

ARISING FROM ANY SOURCE, EVEN IF BENTLEY HAS BEEN

ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

5. Consequences of Breach. (a) Evaluator acknowledges that:

i. Irreparable injury and damage to Bentley will result from unauthorized disclosure of the Test Software, Confidential Information and Proprietary
Information gleaned by Evaluator through use of the Test Software, and from uses of the Test Software other than as contemplated herein;
ii. Monetary damages may not be sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of the Test Software;
iii. Bentley shall be entitled, without waiving any additional rights or remedies available to it at law, in equity, or by statute, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction; and
(b) Evaluator's breach of this EULA shall result in immediate termination of this EULA and may be cause for exclusion in other

Bentley sponsored Test Software programs, among other remedies available to Bentley at law or equity.

     WHEREAS, VidRev is engaged in the marketing and distribution of computer
programs in the United States of America; and

     WHEREAS, VidRev desires to market and distribute the Licensed Software;
and

     WHEREAS, TTA desires to grant to VidRev and VidRev wishes to acquire

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein
contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   Distribution License.
          (a)  Exclusive License.  Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, TTA hereby grants to VidRev the exclusive right to
distribute and further sublicense the distribution and use of the Licensed
Software to Third Party Distributors and End Users subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, provided that, all promotion, marketing, distribution and
use shall be limited geographically to the United States of America, excluding
its territories or possessions. "Third Party Distributor" means any third
party, including affiliates of TTA, which acquire a sublicense from VidRev to
further distribute copies of the Licensed Software to End Users. "End User"
means any third party which, upon payment of a license fee, acquires a
sublicense from VidRev or a Third Party Distributor as provided herein to use
the Licensed Software solely for its own internal use and without any
intention to market, sell or otherwise dispose of the Licensed Software.
VidRev agrees that it will not, and will require that Third Party
Distributor(s) not, without the prior written consent of TTA, transmit or
transfer the Licensed Software, directly or indirectly, in violation of the
geographic restrictions set forth herein.

          (b)  Exclusions from License.  The license set forth in Section 1

use, and require that Third Party Distributors use, commercially reasonable
efforts to promote, advertise, demonstrate, market and distribute the Licensed
Software. VidRev and Third Party Distributor(s) shall sublicense the Licensed
Software to End Users only in accordance with terms and conditions
substantially similar to those found in VidRev's End User License Agreement, a
copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule E (the "Sublicense Agreement").
The Sublicense Agreement may be modified to conform to applicable local laws.
VidRev acknowledges that upon TTA's development of subsequent products, it may
be subject to additional terms and conditions under this Agreement.

     2.   Pricing.  Within thirty (30) calendar days after signing this
Agreement, and then annually thereafter, appropriate representatives of VidRev
will submit to TTA a price proposal for services, including video
conferencing, video telephony, broadcasting, etc., available at that time.
Such proposal will establish minimum licensing fees for both individual and
volume sales for each of the Licensed Software and related services.  TTA and
VidRev will agree to and sign an agreement stating the applicable prices or
fees at that time, and that fee schedule will be incorporated by reference
into this Agreement.

          (a)  Translation of Licensed Software.  TTA hereby grants to
VidRev the non-exclusive right to translate the error messages, prompts,
screen literals and documentation associated with the Licensed Software and
any updates thereto from the original English version into the Spanish
language (all such translations by VidRev shall be referred to as "Foreign
Language Translation").  Except as set forth in this Section 3 (a), all such
translations shall be included within the definition of "Licensed Software"
and governed by the provisions of this Agreement relating thereto, including
without limitation, the payment provisions set forth in Section 4 below.  All

ensure accuracy with the original English version.

     4.   Supply of Licensed Software.

          (a)  Fees and Payment.  VidRev shall pay TTA an initial fee of
One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) upon the execution of this Agreement. Such
payment shall be applied as a credit towards the first One Thousand

payments shall be made in United States (U.S.) Dollars via wire transfer to
TTA's designated bank, Soci t  G n rale, in accordance with the wiring
instructions provided in Schedule B.

          (b)  Royalty.  For each sublicense granted by VidRev or Third

          (c)  Distribution Procedure.  VidRev shall distribute the
Licensed Software in accordance with the Distribution Procedure set forth in
Schedule G.

          (d)  Taxes.  Payments to TTA hereunder shall be paid without
deduction for any withholding tax or of any other amount. If, under any
applicable law, VidRev is required to withhold tax or any other amount from
any such payment, then: (i) any sum payable hereunder shall be increased as
may be necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
4(d)), TTA receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions or withholding (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 4(d) been made; (ii) VidRev shall make such
deductions and withholdings; and (iii) VidRev shall pay the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with
applicable law.  Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of any
of the taxes withheld by VidRev irrespective of any payment to TTA, VidRev

penalties which TTA is at any time obligated to pay or collect in connection
with or arising out of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

          (e)  Promotional Material.  Upon execution and delivery of this
Agreement  TTA shall provide VidRev with technical descriptions to be used in
any promotional materials for Services using the Licensed Software.  VidRev
shall make no other statements, representations or warranties regarding the
Licensed Software or the Services as they relate to the Licensed Software and
shall not take any actions that would bind or obligate TTA or its licensor in
any way.

          (f)  Marks.  TTA grants VidRev a revocable, non-exclusive, non-
transferable, royalty-free license to use and reproduce the trademarks,
service marks, trade names and logos ("Marks") solely in connection with this
Agreement.  VidRev acknowledges that it has no right, title or interest in any
current or future Marks that are used or will be used by VidRev pursuant to
this Agreement.  VidRev further acknowledges that all use of such Marks by
VidRev inures to the benefit of TTA and its licensor.  In addition, to the
extent that VidRev creates any additional Mark(s), VidRev will promptly assign
full right, title and interest to such Mark(s) to TTA, at the request of TTA.
Any use by VidRev of the Mark(s) must be submitted to TTA in writing in
advance for written approval, which approval shall be within the sole
discretion of TTA.  VidRev may affix its own marks on the Licensed Software in
connection with its promotion and sale of the Licensed Software hereunder.

     5.   Upgrades and Improvements.

          (a)  New Versions.  If TTA obtains and markets an improved or
enhanced version of the Licensed Software designated by a new major numerical
sequence (e.g., Version 2.y after prior release of 1.x, where x and y are any
numbers, as distinguished from a new minor numerical sequence such as Version
z.2 after z.l where z is any number) and having substantially new or improved
functions, which TTA's licensor, in its sole discretion, elects to designate
as a "new version" of the Licensed Software (the "New Version") and, if at the
time TTA releases the New Version, VidRev is a party to the Distributor
Maintenance Agreement and is not in breach of any of its obligations, TTA
shall grant to VidRev the non-exclusive right to sublicense such New Version
in accordance with Section 1(a) and such New Version, unless VidRev notifies
TTA as provided below, shall be deemed to be the "Licensed Software" for the
purposes of this Agreement.  The New Version will not become the "Licensed
Software" if VidRev notifies TTA in writing within sixty (60) days from the
date TTA announces the availability of the New Version that VidRev does not
intend to obtain such right to sublicense any New Version, understanding that
TTA shall have no obligation to provide maintenance service.

          (b)  Other Services. TTA shall provide such consulting, training
and installation services with respect to the Licensed Software upon VidRev's
request, at its standard time and materials rates therefor, subject to
availability.

TTA's, or its licensor's patents, trademarks, tradenames or copyrights used in
connection with the Licensed Software, nor contest TTA's exclusive right to
use the same throughout the world;

               (iii)     During the Term (as hereinafter defined) of this
Agreement, VidRev shall use its best efforts promptly to notify TTA in the
event that any End User in the Territory is reselling or otherwise disposing
of the Licensed Software in contravention of TTA's rights hereunder or under
the Sublicense Agreement.  VidRev will render such assistance as reasonably
may be required by TTA with respect thereto and the costs of any action
(including legal expenses) on the part of TTA to protect the Licensed Software
will be borne ninety percent (90%) by VidRev and ten percent (10%) by TTA
unless otherwise agreed by the parties hereto at the relevant time.

               (iv) VidRev covenants that it will not do, permit, or omit
to do anything that would endanger any proprietary rights of TTA or its
licensor, including any patent, trademark, trade-name, design or copyright of
TTA and its licensor, and that it will not claim any proprietary interest in
any patent, copyright, trademark or other right related to the Licensed

SOFTWARE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-
INFRINGEMENT.  NEITHER VIDREV NOR ANY THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTOR(S) SHALL HAVE
THE RIGHT TO MAKE OR PASS ON, AND SHALL TAKE ALL MEASURES NECESSARY TO INSURE
THAT NEITHER IT NOR ANY OF ITS AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES MAKE OR PASS ON, OR ATTEMPT

SUCH DAMAGES OCCURRING.  TTA'S LIABILITY (WHETHER BASED ON AN ACTION OR CLAIM
IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS

secret by any unmodified portion of the Licensed Software, provided that such
party notifies TTA of such claims and proceedings promptly and gives TTA an
opportunity, at TTA's expense, to control the defense and/or settlement of
such claims and proceedings. TTA's obligations under this Section 8(a) shall
not apply to any infringement arising from a modification or misuse by VidRev
or any other party of the Licensed Software or its combination, operation or
use with programs not furnished by TTA.

          (b)  VidRev's and Third Party Distributors' Obligation.  VidRev

parties.

          (b)  Rights of Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated
upon thirty (30) days written notice as follows:

               (i)  by either party upon the filing by the other party of
a voluntary petition in bankruptcy (or similar proceeding relating to either
party's insolvency), or filing against such other party of an involuntary
petition in bankruptcy which is not dismissed within thirty (30) days, or
appointment of a receiver or trustee of any of such other party's property if
such appointment is not vacated within thirty (30) days, or adjudication of
such other party as insolvent, or assignment of such other party's property
for the benefit of its creditors;

               (ii) by either party if the other party fails to comply
with any of its material obligations under this Agreement, and if such failure
remains uncured within such thirty (30) days provided, however, that TTA may
terminate this Agreement immediately upon the breach by VidRev of any of the
provisions of Section 12;

               (iii)     by TTA if any Third Party Distributor fails to comply
with any of its material obligations under its agreement with VidRev, and if
such failure remains uncured thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is
received by VidRev, and VidRev fails to enforce such compliance. TTA may
require that VidRev terminate any agreement with a Third Party Distributor
immediately upon the breach by the Third Party Distributor of TTA's
proprietary rights, extended to it by Section 12;

               (iv) a change in Control of VidRev where such Control is
acquired, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or series of related

the preceding sentence, "Control" shall mean the possession, directly or
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the voting of
more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of an entity's voting
securities, partnership interests, membership interests, or similar equity
interests; or

               (v)  any other transaction which results in the disposition
of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power of all classes of capital
stock of VidRev unless VidRev's stockholders of record as constituted
immediately prior to such acquisition or sale will, immediately after such
acquisition or sale (solely by virtue of securities issued as consideration
for VidRev's acquisition or sale or otherwise) hold at least fifty percent
(50%) of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity.

     The rights of termination provided in this Section 9(b) shall not
prejudice any other rights or remedies which either party may have at law or
in equity.

          (c)  Upon the termination of this Agreement as provided for in
Section 9(a) and (b), VidRev and Third Party Distributor(s) shall return to
TTA all information, confidential or otherwise, relating to the Licensed
Software. Upon such termination, VidRev and Third Party Distributor(s) shall
cease marketing and sublicensing the Licensed Software, except for the
completion of contractual commitments existing on the date of receipt of
notice of termination.

     10.  Third Party Distribution Agreements.  VidRev shall enter into
written distribution agreements with all Third Party Distributor(s) which
shall contain all the obligations, representations and warranties of the Third
Party Distributor set forth in this Agreement.  VidRev shall retain fully
executed copies of all Third Party Distribution Agreements and shall provide
TTA with copies of the same within thirty (30) calendar days of execution.

     11.  Access to Books and Records.  VidRev shall, and shall require that
all Third Party Distributors, keep at their principal places of business
accurate records relating to their sublicense of the Licensed Software.
VidRev and its Third Party Distributors shall deliver to TTA, on a monthly
basis, a report of their sales records, in addition to a separate audited
report within ninety (90) days following the end of each calendar year during
the term of this Agreement statements setting forth such sales, certified by
an independent certified public accountant. Following the delivery of such
certified statement, TTA shall have the right to retain another independent
accountant to inspect VidRev's and Third Party Distributor(s)' records to
verify the sales quantities and other records upon which payments to TTA are
based.  TTA shall pay for the expenses to conduct such audit, provided that if
such audit reveals an underpayment by VidRev and its Third Party Distributors
of more than five percent (5%) of any royalties otherwise due hereunder,
VidRev and its Third Party Distributors shall immediately reimburse TTA for
its audit expense.

     12.  Proprietary Rights.
          (a)  Title to Licensed Software and Confidential Information.  By
virture of this Agreement, VidRev and Third Party Distributor(s) shall not own
or have title to the Licensed Software, nor any Confidential Information and
shall only obtain the licensed rights with respect to the Licensed Software
provided for herein, subject to all of the terms and conditions hereof. VidRev
agrees, and shall require Third Party Distributor(s) not to reverse engineer
or modify the Licensed Software or create a derivative work from the Licensed
Software except as provided for herein.

          (b)  Definition of Confidential Information.  "Confidential
Information" shall mean the Licensed Software, the User Manual and other
documentation related thereto, all modifications, enhancements, improvements
of the foregoing and New Versions, including Foreign Language Translations, in
VidRev's and Third Party Distributor(s') possession hereunder, and all data,
information, techniques, know-how, procedures, specifications, programs,
source code, object code, documentation, diagrams and other materials of any
type whatsoever contained or revealed in any of the foregoing, except for
information generally available to or known to the public, independently
developed outside the scope of this Agreement or lawfully and rightfully
disclosed by a third party. VidRev hereby acknowledges and agrees, and shall
obtain an acknowledgement from Third Party Distributor(s), that the
Confidential Information contains valuable proprietary and confidential
information and trade secrets developed or acquired by TTA, or its
licensor,through the expenditure of substantial time and money.

          (c)  Obligations Regarding Confidential Information.  VidRev
agrees, and shall require Third Party Distributor(s), not to disclose to or
otherwise permit any third person or entity access to the Confidential
Information except to the extent required by with the terms of this Agreement;
to insure that employees who receive access to the Confidential Information or
any portion thereof are advised of the confidential and proprietary nature of
the Confidential Information and to require that any such employee agree to
refrain from taking any action prohibited under this Agreement; to notify TTA
promptly of any circumstances of which VidRev or any Third Party Distributor
has knowledge relating to any possession or use of the Confidential
Information by any person or entity other than those authorized; to take at
the VidRev's expense, but at TTA's option and under TTA's control and
discretion, any legal action necessary to prevent or stop the unauthorized use
of the Confidential Information by any third person or entity who or which has
gained access to such information due in substantial part, to the fault or
negligence of VidRev or any Third Party Distributor.

          (d)  Survival of Confidentiality Obligations; Right to Equitable
Relief.  The obligations and rights of TTA, VidRev, and Third Party
Distributor(s) appointed by VidRev hereafter, under this Section 12 shall
survive any termination of this Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement,
VidRev's and Third Party Distributor(s)' right to possession or use of any
Confidential Information shall terminate and the VidRev and Third Party
Distributor(s) shall immediately deliver to TTA all tangible embodiments of
any of the Confidential Information; provided, however, that any rights
granted by VidRev or Third Party Distributor(s) to any End Users pursuant to
this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

     Because of the unique and proprietary nature of the Confidential
Information, remedies at law for a breach of this Section 12 will be
inadequate and TTA shall, in the event of any such breach, be entitled to
equitable relief including an injunction without any requirement to post a
bond as a condition for such relief, in addition to all other remedies
provided under this Agreement or available at law.

     13.  Dispute Resolution.

          (a)  Except as set forth in this Section 13, any claim or dispute
between the parties hereto pertaining to or arising out of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the negotiation or execution of this
Agreement, or the interpretation, performance or breach of any provision of
this Agreement) shall be arbitrated in New York, New York, U.S.A., before
three neutral arbitrators under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association ("AAA").  Each party shall select one
arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall select a third neutral arbitrator, or
upon their failure to agree, by the procedure of the AAA.  Any arbitration
award shall be accompanied by a written opinion of the arbitrator giving the
legal and factual bases for the award, which award may be entered as a
judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction, or application may be made to
such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an enforcement, as the
law of such jurisdiction may require or allow.  This provision for arbitration
shall be specifically enforceable by the parties.  The arbitral award shall be
final and binding upon the parties who, by signing this Agreement, agree to
and hereby waive all right of appeal, provided that such waiver shall be
subject to the AAA's approval. The arbitrators shall not have the power to
issue and grant permanent injunctive relief and other equitable orders and
remedies. Any such arbitration shall be conducted in confidence and in
accordance with the Section 12(c) of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the arbitrator shall be bound by the
express terms of this Agreement, and shall not change or modify any term of
this Agreement.  Each party shall pay its own expenses of arbitration and the
expenses of the arbitrator shall be equally shared.  Provided however, that
the party deemed the "prevailing party" by the arbitrator or the court in
question, may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and expenses by the
arbitrator.

          (b)  VidRev recognizes that TTA will be irreparably harmed in the
event of VidRev's breach or threatened breach of Section 12(c) of this
Agreement and/or the provisions of this Agreement relating to TTA's rights to
the Intellectual Property, the Licensed Property and VidRev's and Third Party
Distributors and End Users use thereof, and that, notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, TTA may commence an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction, to obtain equitable relief to prevent such breach or
threatened breach, at any time prior to the commencement of an arbitration
proceeding and, if an arbitration proceeding has been commenced, at any time
until an arbitration award is rendered in such arbitration proceeding or the
claim or dispute is otherwise resolved. VidRev shall reimburse TTA for all
fees, costs and expenses including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, costs
and expenses incurred by TTA in taking such court action to obtain equitable
relief.  TTA shall not be deemed to have waived its right to arbitrate any
dispute, claim or controversy by reason of seeking such equitable relief.

          (c)  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its
conflict of laws rules.  The parties hereby expressly exclude the
applicability of the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
of Goods if the same would otherwise apply hereto.  Subject to this Section
13, the parties irrevocably: (i) agree that any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement shall be settled only by final and
binding arbitration in accordance with Section 13(a), provided however, that
TTA shall not be precluded by the foregoing from seeking equitable relief, as
otherwise contemplated in this Agreement, in any court of competent
jurisdiction, (ii) consent and submit to the jurisdiction of any such court or
arbitration panel as provided in Sections 13(a) and (b), (iii) waive any
objection which they, or any of them, may have to personal jurisdiction or the
laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any of such courts,
and agree not to seek to change venue; and (iv) waive the right to trial by
jury in any suit, action or other proceeding.

          (d)  The parties hereby consent to service of process for any
action or proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement at the
party's address listed above, by reputable courier service which requires a
signed acknowledgement of receipt and which utilizes an automated delivery
tracking system.

     14.  Export.  VidRev hereby assures TTA and agrees that neither it nor
any Third Party Distributor(s) intends to nor will they knowingly export or
reexport directly or indirectly the Licensed Software (or any commodity and/or
technical data or a system incorporating such commodity and/or technical data
acquired from TTA), without first obtaining the written approval of TTA and
then obtaining the written approval or required export license to do so from
the United States Department of Commerce or any other agency of the U.S.
Government or of any foreign government having jurisdiction over such
transaction, when required by an applicable statute, regulation or order.

     15.  Governmental Restrictions.  TTA and VidRev shall each comply with
all relevant governmental regulations (in so far as the same shall relate to
the licensing of the Licensed Software pursuant hereto) in each country in the
Territory.

     16.  Escrow of Source Code.  TTA agrees to make available a copy of the
source code for the Licensed Software, updated to reflect New Versions, in
escrow with DSI Technology Escrow Services, located at 2100 Norcross Parkway,
Suite 150, Norcross, Georgia 30071.  The escrow agreement shall provide that
such source code may not be released to VidRev unless TTA and its licensor:(i)
shall have ceased to carry on business, either voluntarily or because of a
liquidation resulting from any bankruptcy proceeding; (ii) shall have decided
to discontinue all support and maintenance services for the Licensed Software;
or (iii) shall have each given their prior written consent to such release.
The escrow agreement shall also provide for the licensing of the source code
to be used only for maintenance purposes pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, and the source code shall be subject to strict confidentiality
provisions.

the entire agreement of the parties and supersede any prior agreements,
whether written or oral, between them. Any amendments or modifications of this
Agreement shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto. The terms of
this Agreement shall prevail and govern over any inconsistent or contradictory
terms in a purchase order issued pursuant to this Agreement. No waiver by any
party of any breach of any provision hereof shall constitute a waiver of any
other breach of that or any other provision hereof. This Agreement shall be
binding upon the parties, their successors and assigns; provided, however,
that VidRev shall not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties
hereunder, without the prior written consent of TTA. Neither party shall be
liable or deemed to be in default for any delay or failure in performance
under this Agreement for any cause beyond the reasonable control of such
party. Should any part of this Agreement be held invalid, illegal or void, the
remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such
part had been deleted or never included. Any headings used in this Agreement

Territory:     The United States of America, excluding its territories and

sub-distributor will be required to refer such sale to the TTA licensee who
has a license to sell in such area and sub-distributor will be entitled to
receive a fifteen percent (15%) referral fee to be shared on an equitable
basis with VidRev.

     If sales are conducted online, it will be important to distinguish
between sale vs. use (i.e., subsidiary may sell to a resident of a country in
its territory who actually uses it in another country, in which case
subsidiary would be deemed to have sold the product within its territory).
Any online sales must comply with both the territory and exclusive market
restrictions herein.

IMPORTANT: READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING AND USING TRUST BASED FEATURES ON ANY OF THESE PROPRIETARY PLATFORMS!
THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE "EULA") CONSTITUTES A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU, ACTING ON BEHALF OF YOUR BUSINESS ENTITY ("YOU" OR "LICENSEE"), AS THE END USER, AND RUCKUS WIRELESS, INC. INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES (COLLECTIVELY "RUCKUS") FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSE FEATURES IDENTIFIED ABOVE, WHICH INCLUDES THE OBJECT CODE VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (THE "SOFTWARE LICENSE").
Software Licenses. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and payment of the applicable license fees, Ruckus and its suppliers grant to you ("End User") a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, limited license to use the Trust Based Software Licensed features in object code form internally, solely for the purpose of operating Ruckus networking switches. The Software is licensed on a per unit basis. Each Software License or Certificate or Entitlement will contain a unique serial number. Upon internal transfer of one Software License to a different unit, Licensee must disable and discontinue the use of the Trust Based Software Licensed feature on the previously used unit.
The same Software License, determined by the unique serial number, cannot be applied to more than one unit at a time. The same Software License, determined by the unique serial number, can only be applied once to the same unit.
End User may make such backup copies of the Software License or Certificate of Entitlement as may be necessary for End User's lawful use, provided End User affixes to such copies all trademark, copyright, patent, and notices of other proprietary rights that appear on the original. End User must keep accurate and verifiable records of its use of the Software Licenses.
BY ACCESSING AND USING TRUST BASE FEATURES, INCLUDING ANY UPDATES, UPGRADES, OR NEWER VERSIONS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA.
IF YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, ACTIVATE THE TRUST BASE FEATURE USING THE APPROPRIATE COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE (CLI) COMMAND. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, DO NOT ACTIVATE THE TRUST BASE FEATURE.
Limitations. All Software Licensed features delivered hereunder are licensed, not sold. Licensee may not extract or run any component of the Software independently. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, End User shall have no right, and End User specifically agrees not to, and not to permit third parties to: (i) modify, adapt, change, enhance or create derivative works based upon the Software License key; (ii) decompile, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software License key to human-readable form (except to the extent that applicable law or any public license prohibits reverse engineering restrictions); (iv) use the Software License key on any Ruckus networking switches in excess of the maximum number of Ruckus networking switches for which End User is licensed; or v) remove, modify or otherwise tamper with any notice or legend on any labeling on any physical media containing the Software License key. End-User's rights in the Software License key will be limited to those expressly granted herein. To the extent that the Licensee creates derivative software or a derivative software license key ("Derivative Software License") by a method described in part (ii) of this Section, or by using any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms, structure, architecture or algorithms of the Software License key and by permissible means under both this Agreement and under local, state or federal law, this Agreement prevents Licensor from using, distributing or licensing any Derivative Software License key that competes with the Trust Based Software License feature or any other Ruckus product for commercial uses. All use, distribution or license of the Derivative Software License key, regardless if it directly or indirectly competes with the Trust Based Software License feature or other Ruckus products, must comply with this Agreement to the extent such compliance is permitted under applicable laws.
Upgrades and Additional Copies. For purposes of this Agreement, the Software License shall also include any upgrades, updates, bug fixes or modified versions ("Upgrades") provided to End User by Ruckus or an authorized distributor, along with any backup copies of the Software License keys, for which End User had paid the applicable license and support and maintenance fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, End User acknowledges and agrees that Ruckus and its resellers and distributors shall have no obligation to provide any Upgrades. If Upgrades or additional

No Support. Ruckus may, but is not required to, provide technical support. Technical support may be provided at an additional cost and/may be subject to additional terms and conditions.
Security Notice. Use of the security features of the Trust Based Software License feature does not guarantee the security of End User's network. The Trust Based Software License feature provided under this Agreement is not designed to offer functionality providing security and access management for the processing and/or storage of the following categories of data: (1) data that is classified and or used on the U.S. Munitions list, including software and technical data; (2) articles, services and related technical data designated as defense articles and defense services; (3) ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) related data; and (4) other personally identifiable information that is subject to heightened security requirements as a result of Licensee's internal policies or practices or by law or regulation ("Excluded Data"). Licensee agrees that Licensee is solely responsible for reviewing and ensuring that any data it provides to Ruckus (or to which Ruckus will have access) does not contain Excluded Data.
Disclaimer of Warranty. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RUCKUS PROVIDES THE TRUST BASED SOFTWARE LICENSE FEATURE "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. NEITHER RUCKUS NOR ITS THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS WARRANT THAT THE TRUST BASED SOFTWARE LICENSE FEATURE IS ERROR FREE, MEET END USER REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE IN THE COMBINATINS WHICH END USER MAY SELECT FOR USE, OR THAT END USER WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE TRUST BASED SOFTWARE LICENSE FEATURE WITHOUT PROBLEMS OR INTERRUPTIONS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RUCKUS AND ITS SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, AND SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. IF LICENSEE MADE ITS PURCHASE THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, RUCKUS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY SUCH THIRD PARTY.
Limitation of Liability. RUCKUS AND ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, OR FOR LOSS OF REVENUE OR PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR ANY DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT DIRECT, EVEN IF RUCKUS OR SUCH SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL RUCKUS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00 U.S.). THESE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY WILL NOT BE AFFECTED IF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS LIMITED LIABILITY PROVISION IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE BASIS OF RUCKUS' BARGAIN HEREUNDER, AND RUCKUS WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU ABSENT SUCH LIMITATIONS. 
Proprietary Rights. End-User acknowledges that the Trust Based Software License feature is the proprietary/confidential information of Ruckus and any unauthorized disclosure to a third party constitutes a material breach of this Agreement. The Trust Based Software License feature, including all intellectual property rights therein, is and will remain the sole and exclusive property of Ruckus or its suppliers.

AGREEMENT (THE "AGREEMENT") FOR THE LICENSE OF THE SOFTWARE
(THE "SOFTWARE") AND/OR HARDWARE (THE "HARDWARE") PRODUCT

TECHNOLOGIES").  BY CLICKING THE ACCEPTANCE BUTTON OR
INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE OR USING THE HARDWARE, YOU (EITHER
AN INDIVIDUAL OR A SINGLE ENTITY) ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND
BY AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CLICK THE
BUTTON THAT INDICATES THAT YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS AND
DO NOT INSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND RETURN THE PRODUCT TO AZO
TECHNOLOGIES.

If the product you received is labeled "Eval", then you have
the evaluation version ("Evaluation Version").  If the
product you received is labeled "Beta", then you have the
beta version ("Beta Version").  If the product you received
is labeled neither "Eval" or "Beta", then you have the
full-use version ("Full-Use Version").

Users with either the Evaluation Version or the Beta Version may
use the product for only thirty (30) days, after which period you
must either buy the product from AZO Technologies, Inc. or remove
the software from your computer, stop using it, and return any
hardware components to AZO Technologies.

Users that upgrade from either the Evaluation Version or the Beta
Version by obtaining a valid registration code from AZO
Technologies convert their product to the Full-Use Version upon
receiving the registration code and are subsequently bound by the
terms in this Agreement as if they had originally obtained the
Full-Use Version.

If you have the Evaluation Version or the Beta Version, your
right to use the Product is limited.  If you have already
installed a prior Evaluation Version or Beta Version of the
Product, you may not use that Product and must immediately cease
using that Software and destroy it.  To obtain full-use rights,
you must pay for the Product or a valid registration code.

1.  License Grant.  Subject to the payment of the applicable
license fees, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, AZO Technologies hereby grants to you a non-exclusive,
non-transferable right to use one copy of the specified version
of the Product and the accompanying documentation (the
"Documentation").  If you have the Evaluation Version or Beta
Version, this right is solely for your internal evaluation or
testing purposes during the term of this Agreement.

a.  Use.  You may install one copy of the Software on one
personal computer or on one Pocket PC personal digital assistant
depending on the electronic device for which the Software was
designed (collectively, a "Client Device").  If the Software is
licensed as a suite or bundled with more than one specified
Software product, this license applies to all such specified
Software products, subject to any restrictions or usage terms
specified on the applicable price list or product packaging that
apply to any of such Software products individually.  The
Software is licensed as a single product; it may not be used on
more than one Client Device or by more than one user at a time,
except as set forth in this Section 1.  The Software is "in use"
on a Client Device when it is loaded into the temporary memory
(i.e., random-access memory or RAM) or installed into the
permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage
device) of that Client Device.  The Software cannot be
temporarily transfered to a different computer for the purposes
of sharing the license.  You can permanently transfer a license
to a different computer.  This license authorizes you to make one
copy of the Software solely for backup or archival purposes,
provided that the copy you make contains all of the Software's

I.R.I.S. grants the licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license for one (1) user to install the I.R.I.S. product on a single personal computer and use the I.R.I.S. product and one copy of the associated user documentation contained in the accompanying user manual, "online" help and Acrobat files. The license of I.R.I.S. product is granted in every country where the licensee acknowledges that his consumer rights are prevailing from any local or regional or national restrictions of using such license without violating any laws, treaties, government rules or any official rules preventing the licensee to enjoy such license as is. If additional programming seats are needed, the licensee should contact I.R.I.S. for discounted license pricing. The license granted hereunder applies only to the designated version of the enclosed I.R.I.S. product. If the I.R.I.S. product is an upgrade or cross-grade, it, and the product that was upgraded/cross graded constitute a single copy of the I.R.I.S. product for purposes hereof and the new version and product that was upgraded/cross-graded cannot be used by two people at the same time.
3. The license agreement is the entire and sole understanding between I.R.I.S. and the licensee with respect to the I.R.I.S. product and documentation. It supersedes all prior understandings or communications, whether written or oral.
4. The copyright on the I.R.I.S. product and documentation and all further intellectual rights of I.R.I.S. remain its exclusive property. I.R.I.S. shall under no circumstances be bound to communicate its source code(s). In consideration of payment of the license fee, included in the product price, I.R.I.S. only grants the licensee, under the terms and conditions of this agreement, the right to use the I.R.I.S. product and documentation.
5. The licensed I.R.I.S. product must be solely and exclusively used together with the specific I.R.I.S. software it was delivered with or developed for. Under no circumstances will the licensee be entitled to use any product directly or indirectly originating with, distributed or manufactured by I.R.I.S. with any other software than the licensed software program. Furthermore, without prejudice to article 6 if the licensee does not comply with the present provision, I.R.I.S. will under no circumstances be held liable for any malfunctioning whatsoever of its product, nor for any direct or indirect, incidental or consequential damage caused by the use of a third-party's software program and I.R.I.S. cannot in this event be held by any warranty whatsoever related to its product or its licensed software program.

I.R.I.S. End-User License Agreement (EULA)
6. The licensee shall abstain from reproducing, electronically transferring, copying, translating, modifying or reverse-engineering any part of the I.R.I.S. product or documentation, except in so far as the electronic transfer of the I.R.I.S. product to a host computer's memory is required for the normal I.R.I.S. product utilization. He may be held responsible for any infringement of intellectual rights caused or made possible by his failure to abide by the terms of this agreement.
7. The I.R.I.S. product and documentation are licensed to the licensee and may not be transferred, neither wholly or partly, to anyone without the prior written consent of I.R.I.S.
8. This license is effective until terminated. The license terminates automatically without notice from I.R.I.S. if the licensee fails to comply with any provision of this agreement. Upon termination he shall destroy all copies of the I.R.I.S. product and documentation or alternatively return the same to I.R.I.S. or alternatively ask I.R.I.S Customer Service for a "Letter of Destruction".
9. I.R.I.S. does not warrant that the I.R.I.S. product will run without interruptions or that it will be free from errors nor that all discovered errors shall be corrected. All I.R.I.S. product and documentation are delivered as such without any express or implied warranty. In particular, I.R.I.S. does not warrant its merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose. In no event shall I.R.I.S. be liable for any direct or indirect, incidental or consequential damages caused by the I.R.I.S. product or documentation.
10. I.R.I.S. may create upgraded versions of the I.R.I.S. product and documentation. I.R.I.S. will make such updates available to licensees who have paid the update fee.
11. Under no circumstances, I.R.I.S. and its OCR ("Optical Character Recognition") technologies shall be held responsible by any users for illegal use of I.R.I.S. technology resulting in reproducing, electronic transferring, copying, translating or modifying any part of documentation or information without appropriate authorization from the official owner of the copyright of such documentation or information.
12. The license is only valid for end user utilization, it does not give the licensee the right to resell the product, to integrate the included I.R.I.S. technology or to propose additional services across the Internet. The license allows the use of the included I.R.I.S. technology across an Intranet or an Extranet. The license is not valid for use as a runtime license of an I.R.I.S. component integrated into a third-party application and/or Internetbased service. Exception to article 12 is possible if, in a separate written agreement signed between the licensee and I.R.I.S., the license has expressly been sold as a component of this third-party application and/or Internet-based service integrating I.R.I.S. technology and therefore every terms of the license are applicable to both end user utilization license and integrated license utilization.
13. Should the product concerned be an I.R.I.S.'s hardware product, this EULA covers warranty obligations for this hardware product limited to the terms set forth below: 1. I.R.I.S., as defined below, warrants this I.R.I.S.-branded hardware product against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of ONE (1) YEAR outside EEC, TWO (2) years inside EEC from the date of retail purchase by the original end-user purchaser ("Warranty Period"). If a hardware defect arises and a valid claim is received within the Warranty Period, at its option and to the extent permitted by law, I.R.I.S. will either (1) repair the hardware defect at no charge, using new parts or parts equivalent to new in performance and reliability, (2) exchange the product with a product that is new or equivalent to new in performance and reliability and is at least functionally equivalent to the original product, or (3) refund the

I.R.I.S. End-User License Agreement (EULA)
purchase price of the product. 2. I.R.I.S. may request that you replace defective parts with new or refurbished user-
installable parts that I.R.I.S. provides in fulfillment of its warranty obligation. A replacement product or part, including a user installable part that has been installed in accordance with instructions provided by I.R.I.S., assumes the remaining warranty of the original product or ninety (90) days from the date of replacement or repair, which ever provides longer coverage for you. When a product or part is exchanged, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced item becomes I.R.I.S.'s property. Parts provided by I.R.I.S. in fulfillment of its warranty obligation must be used in products for which warranty service is claimed. 3. When a refund is given, the product for which the refund is provided must be returned to I.R.I.S. and becomes I.R.I.S.'s property. 4. EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS 1. This Limited Warranty applies only to the hardware product manufactured by or
for I.R.I.S. that can be identified by the "I.R.I.S." trademark, trade name, or logo affixed to it. The Limited Warranty does not apply to any non-I.R.I.S. hardware product or any software, even if packaged or sold with the I.R.I.S. hardware. Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers, other than I.R.I.S., may provide their own warranties to the end user purchaser, but I.R.I.S., in so far as permitted by law, provides their products "as is". Software distributed by I.R.I.S. with or without the I.R.I.S. brand name (including, but not limited to system software) is not covered under this Limited Warranty. Refer to the licensing agreement accompanying the software for details of your rights with respect to its use. 2. This warranty does not apply: (a) to consumable parts, such as batteries or cables, unless damage has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship; (b) to cosmetic damage, including but not limited to scratches, dents, and broken plastic on ports; (c) to damage caused by accident, abuse, misuse, flood, fire, earthquake or other external causes; (d) to damage caused by operating the product outside the permitted or intended uses described by I.R.I.S.; (e) to damage caused by service (including upgrades and expansions) performed by anyone who is not a representative of I.R.I.S. or an I.R.I.S. Authorized Reseller; (f) to a product or part that has been modified to alter functionality or capability without the written permission of I.R.I.S.; or (g) if any I.R.I.S. serial number has been removed or defaced. 3. Important: Do not open the hardware product. Opening the hardware product may cause damage that is not covered by this warranty. Only I.R.I.S. or an authorized service provider should perform service on this hardware product.
14. In the event that a claim is filed in a court of competent jurisdiction alleging that the I.R.I.S. product, its related documentation, its trademarks, its copyrights and its trade names used within the scope of the license granted hereunder directly infringes any copyright or trade secret of any third party ("infringement action"), I.R.I.S. shall indemnify, defend and hold the licensee harmless from and against such infringement action and any and all costs, damages, penalties and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, finally resulting from or awarded in actions attributable to such claim, provided that (a) the licensee promptly notifies I.R.I.S. in writing of the existence of such infringement action when the licensee becomes aware of such infringement action, (b) I.R.I.S. has control of the defense of such infringement action and all related settlement negotiations, and (c) the licensee provides all reasonable assistance and cooperation in such defense. In the event of an infringement claim for which I.R.I.S. is obligated to indemnify the licensee, I.R.I.S. may, at its sole discretion, (i) obtain a license that allows the licensee to continue using the I.R.I.S. product, or (ii) replace or modify the I.R.I.S. product so as to be non-infringing in a manner that does not materially affect its functionality. The foregoing represents I.R.I.S.' sole responsibility to the licensee in the event of a third-
IRIS© 1987-2013 "End-user License Agreement"

I.R.I.S. End-User License Agreement (EULA)
party infringement claim of any kind, and it is agreed that I.R.I.S. will have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in connection with any third party patent claims. In any case, the yearly maximum amount of indemnification will not exceed the amount of license fee received by I.R.I.S. from the licensee according to this present agreement. 15. This I.R.I.S. license agreement is fully effective for I.R.I.S. products as for a third-party hardware product. It gives the same rights and obligations to both parties, I.R.I.S. and the licensee. Article 13 is valid for hardware products whoever the hardware manufacturer may be. 16. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I.R.I.S. shall have no responsibility for claims arising solely as a result of the modifications made by the licensee to the I.R.I.S. product. In case of claims arising from the combined use of I.R.I.S.' product with the licensee's solution, the responsibility shall be shared by both I.R.I.S. and the licensee if the real cause of the problem for which such claims are lodged can not be clearly identified to be from the I.R.I.S.' side or from the licensee's side.

Either party may terminate this Agreement, effective immediately upon written notice, if the other party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy or any proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or composition for the benefit of creditors, if that petition or proceeding is not dismissed with prejudice within sixty (60) days after filing.  If Licensor is terminating the license for cause, and you have acquired a subscription license, you remain liable for all unpaid subscription fees that are payable for the entire Subscription Term.  Within thirty (30) days following any expiration or termination, an authorized signatory of your organization will certify in writing to Licensor that the original and all copies of the Software have been destroyed.   The provisions of Sections 7 (so long as Fees are due from you), 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and any definitions in Exhibit A  shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR />

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensor, its suppliers and its Authorized Partners from and against liabilities, costs, damages and expenses (including settlement costs and reasonable attorney fees) arising from any claims from anybody that result from or relate to you and your third parties&#39; use, reproduction or distribution of the Software or any permitted Applications herein.<BR />

&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR />
15.    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IF YOU SHOULD BECOME ENTITLED TO CLAIM DAMAGES FROM LICENSOR FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THIRD PARTY INFRINGEMENT), LICENSOR WILL BE LIABLE ONLY FOR THE AMOUNT OF YOUR ACTUAL DIRECT DAMAGES, NOT TO EXCEED (IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS) THE FEES, IF ANY, YOU PAID TO LICENSOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITHIN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EARLIEST DATE ON WHICH THE ACT OR OMISSION GIVING RISE TO YOUR CLAIM OCCURRED OR SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED, AS APPLICABLE.   The provisions of this Agreement allocate the risks between you and Licensor.  The Fees reflect this allocation of risk and the limitations of liability herein. EACH EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION IS INTENDED TO BE A SEPARATE AND THEREFORE SEVERABLE EXCLUSION.  The parties agree that the limitations specified in this Section 15 will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR />
16.    EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, MISREPRESENTATION AND OTHER CONTRACT OR TORT CLAIMS; LOST PROFITS; OR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS OF DATA, SECURITY BREACH, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR LOST SAVINGS), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE OR OF ANY OTHER OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. The limitations of liability set forth in Sections 15 and 16 will survive and apply notwithstanding the failure of any limited or exclusive remedy for breach of warranty set forth in this Agreement. The Parties agree that the foregoing limitations will not be read so as to limit any liability to an extent that would not be permitted under applicable law and specifically will not limit any liability for gross negligence, intentional tortious or unlawful conduct or damages for strict liability that may not be limited by law.<BR />

b) The guaranteed licence described on Paragraph 4(A) will expire 60 days after the Delivery Date if CODICE does not receive the amount to be paid for the licence. In the case that the licence expired due to lack of payment, the SOFTWARE will no longer work. This is due to design and it is not a SOFTWARE defect.

Spain
Appendix A: SOFTWARE Description

The SOFTWARE to be delivered as stated under this Agreement, CODICE-PLASTIC SCM, is a software configuration management system which provides repository, versioning, change control, shared access, integration, communication, auditing, and information services for groups of engineers, technicians and managers developing, maintaining and releasing production software.
The SOFTWARE functions as describes on CODICE´s User's Guide.
CODICE keeps a published list of the Platforms on which the SOFTWARE is supported.
PlasticSCM is a client/server system which operates on heterogeneous platforms. The SOFTWARE is formed of a main server, plasticd, an instance which runs on a server machine and manages access to the main repository; and it is also formed of a main client SOFTWARE, cm, instances of which are invoked locally on each client machine which holds a workspace. The SOFTWARE also includes the rest of the modules for which there is a link to the User's Guide as well as the documentation which can be access from CODICE´s website (http://www.plasticscm.com/infocenter.aspx).
Other utility, administration and demonstration programmes can be included.
Usually, each user will have its own exclusive client installation, which has copies of the repository files with specified revisions. The server is formed of a request administrator, a data manager and a revisions repository. The data manager executes database services and keeps a set of control data which describes the status and history of revisions from the repository files, as well as any transaction carried out on it. The request administrator sequences the actions and controls all the communication with the client.
CODICE provides a transactional change mode based on atomic submissions of multiple files as one transactional change. CODICE provides a mechanism to selectively keep synchronization on client work areas with the server, so the client's installations can be reliably updated.
CODICE supports parallel development and informs, from the repository, of the client's status, history of the file changes and work in progress.
Appendix B: Support Terms and Conditions

1. Services Provided
Considering the Technical Support price paid by the CUSTOMER and the Customer's agreement of complying with the responsibilities established below, CODICE will give the CUSTOMER the following Technical Assistance and Maintenance services
Technical Assistance
a) CODICE will help the CUSTOMER to identify any errors and malfunctioning produced when the CUSTOMER uses the SOFTWARE.
b) CODICE will provide the CUSTOMER with support services in order to try to correct any error and malfunctioning identified. CODICE is not held responsible for any error or malfunctioning caused by any hardware or third parties using the system.
c) All Technical Assistance will be done between 9.00 and 18.00 GMT +1, from Monday to Friday, excluding Holidays.
d) CODICE will provide Technical Assistance via email.

e) CODICE acquires the following commitments in order to answer to the Customer's Technical Assistance requests:
a. to accept/acknowledge the support request via email within one (1) business day from the request's receipt.
b. to inform the CUSTOMER about the current situation of the problem and to insert a Work Report on CODICE´s tracking system when appropriate.
c. to provide an answer within three (3) working days specifying CODICE´s analysis and assessment including options and the estimated time for resolving the matter.
d. CODICE will make a report on the software's amendment.
Maintenance
a) CODICE will provide the CUSTOMER with every new release of the SOFTWARE published during the Technical Support Agreement to be downloaded as established on Paragraph 3(A). All downloads must be done by the CUSTOMER. CODICE will do its best to provide with releases which include corrections and will help the CUSTOMER to use the SOFTWARE in order to avoid identified errors, defects or malfunctions.
b) The CUSTOMER will just receive the software which CODICE considers as part of the Program. For example: the CUSTOMER is entitled to any update an upgrade of the SOFTWARE, but if CODICE releases a new software with related but different functionalities with another product name, the CUSTOMER will not be entitled to the mentioned software as update for the SOFTWARE.
c) The CUSTOMER is entitled to download, with no additional cost, versions of the SOFTWARE for any additional Platform from CODICE that appears on the published list in CODICE´s list of products, as long as the aggregated configuration of users in all the servers does not exceed the Licence Configuration.
d) From time to time CODICE can choose to stop maintenance of certain Platforms. CODICE will do this in two steps: first the Platform will be designated "Obsolescent", which means that CODICE will make new releases for the mentioned Platform only after the Customer's explicit request; this should not be sooner than a year after being designated "Obsolescent", the Platform will be declared as "Interrupted", which means that CODICE will not make any new release for that Platform. Platforms designations "Obsolescent" and "Interrupted" will be published on CODICE´s website and the CUSTOMER will be responsible of checking on this website if there has been any change on a Platform's designation.
e) The designation of a Platform as "Obsolescent" or "Interrupted" will not affect CODICE´s obligation of providing Technical Assistance as established on Paragraphs from A to E on this section.
f) The CUSTOMER has the right to change the server IP addresses, port numbers or Platforms on the authorised configuration of the Licence with no additional cost after written notification given to CODICE.
2. Customer responsibilities
a) The CUSTOMER compromises to acquire, incorporate and keep updated the Program to the last release supplied by CODICE
b) The CUSTOMER will designate the appropriate number of person(s) as Technical Support contact(s), as agreed among the parties. The total number of contacts will not be more than two (2) contacts per one hundred (100) users. The CUSTOMER has the right to change the contacts any time giving written notice to CODICE.
c) In the case that the CUSTOMER does not comply with his obligations as established on the preceding two paragraphs, this would allow CODICE to deny providing Technical Support until the CUSTOMER complies with his obligations.

B. Evaluation Licenses.

Micro Focus EULA (1 November 2019)

written consent. At any time during the Evaluation Term or upon completion thereof, Licensee may, upon written notification to Licensor and payment of the applicable license fee, replace the Evaluation License with a license to use the Licensed Software that is not restricted to evaluation purposes. In the absence of such notification by Licensee, the Evaluation License shall automatically terminate at the end of the Evaluation Term, and Licensee shall return, or, if Licensor so directs, delete and destroy all such Licensed Software and provide Licensor with written confirmation of its compliance with this provision. Upon written request from Licensee, Licensor may, in its sole discretion, grant Licensee an extension in writing prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Term. Other than updates to Licensed Software provided as part of support and maintenance, Licensed Software provided by Licensor free of license fee charge shall be deemed to be provided for evaluation purposes only.

C. Bundles/Suites. If the Licensed Software is licensed in a bundle or suite of multiple products, and the applicable Product Order specifies the License Option and license count for the bundle or suite (but not the individual product components of the bundle or suite), then each product in the bundle or suite shall share such license type and count. For example, individual products in the bundle or suite cannot be used by multiple users if only one user license is purchased (for user-based licenses) and cannot be installed on multiple devices or servers if only one device or server license is purchased (for device or server-based licenses).
2. USE RESTRICTIONS. Except as may be otherwise specifically permitted in the applicable ALA, Licensee agrees not to, directly or indirectly:
A. Copy, distribute or use the Licensed Software, in whole or in part (such as any portion, feature, function, or user interface) without paying Licensor the applicable fees;

Early termination of this Agreement shall not entitle Licensee to any refund or reimbursement of any previously paid fees.

Software as a Service. You must have purchased an MSA or UPP, or, purchased specific

Subscription Terms for the SaaS Offering in Your Ordering Document, and agreed to the Terms and Conditions

for MindManager User Account & MindManager Cloud Services available at the following link [insert link]

("T&Cs") and hereby incorporated herein by reference to them in this EULA, to be able to exercise the license

under the terms of this Section 1.b. To the extent that any of the provisions of this EULA are inconsistent or

conflict with those of the T&C's, the T&C's shall govern and supersede the provisions of this EULA solely in

respect of the SaaS Offering. If You have purchased a license to use the SaaS Offering through any of the

foregoing means, then subject to Your full and ongoing compliance with this EULA and the T&Cs, Corel grants

You, during the Term, a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable (except as set forth in Section 13.k and Section

14.c below), non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the SaaS Offering solely for the number of

Users You have specified in the Ordering Document and solely in accordance with the Documentation. Your

purchase of a license for the SaaS Offering in accordance with this EULA allows You and Users to access and use

the Cloud Operating Features. You agree to register a SaaS Offering account with Corel in accordance with the

specifications set out in the Ordering Document, those of the Supported Environment, and in compliance with

the T&Cs to gain access to and use the SaaS Offering. Each User that You or Your Administrator assigns a User

Credential to at the time of registering Your SaaS Offering account or anytime thereafter during the Term, shall

count as a Seat under this Section 1.b for the purposes of this EULA and the Ordering Document. Each User so

assigned shall be able to use the SaaS Offering and its Cloud Operating Features. Without prejudice to the

foregoing limitation on simultaneous use under Section 1.b, a User may utilize their Seat for the Cloud

Operating Features of the SaaS Offering simultaneously when using the Seat of a Software Installation under

Section 1.b. A User may also use their same Seat for the SaaS Offering simultaneously through the

MindManager Go Mobile App from their smart phone or tablet and through MindManager for Teams from one

other device. You shall, and shall ensure that Your Administrator shall, at all times, protect Your SaaS Offering

account details and password, the devices Users use to access, that are accessed by, or that are used through

Page 4 of 10

the SaaS Offering and SaaS Offering account, from all unauthorized use. You shall be solely responsible for creating backup files of all data accessed by or used through the SaaS Offering and You further agree that Corel is not liable for any damages relating to lost, corrupted, or damaged data.

You agree not to: (i) use the SaaS Offering in a way that violates any applicable laws or regulations; (ii) distribute viruses or other harmful or malicious computer code via the SaaS Offering; (iii) engage in any conduct that disrupts or impedes the SaaS Offering; (iv) engage in "screen scraping", "database scraping", "data mining", or any other activity with the purpose of obtaining lists of users or other information from the SaaS Offering or that uses web "bots" or similar data gathering or extraction methods; or (v) use the SaaS Offering for purposes for which it not designed/intended, e.g. sending unsolicited advertisements (SPAM). Corel can suspend Your access to the SaaS Offering if, in its sole discretion, Corel believes: (i) there is risk to the security or privacy of Your account (or to the security or privacy of another customer's account); (ii) there is a threat to the security or integrity of Corel's network or the SaaS Offering; or (iii) suspension is needed to protect the rights, property, or safety of Corel, its users, or the public or is required by law.

d. Named User License. Notwithstanding the foregoing feature of simultaneous use, You shall not, and shall ensure that Your Administrator shall not, allow or suffer any User Credential in respect of a Software Installation or SaaS Offering, to be used by more than one individual User, to whom such User Credential is assigned, unless it has been reassigned in its entirety to another individual User, in which case the prior User shall no longer have any right to access or use the Software, SaaS Offering and/or Documentation. If You have purchased multiple User licenses and Seats for use by You or Your Users (Named User), You may without prejudice to mandatory local copyright law reassign a User license / Seat from one User to another User, only if: (i) the original User's relationship with You has been terminated; or (ii) the original User relationship with You has been transferred to a non-licensed department within Your legal entity.

e. License Term. Unless otherwise specified in the Ordering Document, the initial Subscription Term is one (1) year commencing from the date of Your purchase of the Software and is automatically renewable in accordance with Section 3.d.

of Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun

become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to 
become, the subject of a claim of intellectual 
property infringement or trade secret 
misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use

writing to Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will

negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by 
you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated 
warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states

      3.1. Availability of Source Code.
      Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

      3.2. Modifications.
      The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

      3.3. Required Notices.
      You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

      3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients. rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      3.6. Larger Works.
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

      4.1. New Versions.
      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

      4.2. Effect of New Versions.
      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

      4.3. Modified Versions.
      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

   COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN .AS IS. BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as .Participant.) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY.S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

   The Covered Software is a .commercial item,. as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of .commercial computer software. (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Âº 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and .commercial computer software documentation. as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991


Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

   One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

   Copyright (C)

   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

   Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
   Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

   signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
   Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.


"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2

Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words

"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code."

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module.? An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.? If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so.? If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended 
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose 
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make 
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone
understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what 
they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to
avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain 
patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have
made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

</html>SUBSCRIPTION END USER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
This End User License Agreement (this "Agreement") is between the legal entity or entities that accept(s) this Agreement by physical or electronic signature, or by a click-through acceptance ("Licensee" or "Customer"), and Spanning ("Spanning"). This Agreement is effective as of the earlier of the date set forth on the signature page hereto or the date on which this Agreement is accepted through an accompanying Order Form, as applicable (such date, the "Effective Date").
This Agreement applies to all Software licensed from or any Service provided by Spanning, including any pre-release or beta versions of the Software, any Support Services or Professional Services performed by Spanning, any Hardware provided by Spanning with Software pre-installed, any demonstration or trial versions of the Software, and the Documentation. If Licensee is bound to more than one agreement with Spanning with respect to the Software or the Service(s), and if those agreements terms vary, then the order of precedence of those agreements is as follows: an agreement executed by Spanning and Licensee that expressly supersedes all other agreements, an electronic version of an agreement accepted pursuant to an Order Form or formal written quote, and any other electronic agreement provided with the Software.
1. Definitions. The terms in this section shall have the meanings described below, and other terms may be defined within the context of this Agreement.
1.1. "Confidential Information" means information that is designated in writing as "confidential" at the time of disclosure, or which constitutes the trade secrets of a party under the governing law of this Agreement. Confidential Information also includes the Object Code of the Software, the pricing structure for the Software and Services provided to Licensee, and any other proprietary information owned by Spanning and which is provided or disclosed to Licensee at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) is in the public domain or is generally publicly known through no improper action by the receiving party; (b) was rightfully in the receiving party's possession or known by it prior to receipt from the disclosing party; (c) is rightfully disclosed without restriction to the receiving party by a third party without violation of any confidentiality covenant by such third party; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party.
1.2. "Customer Data" means any and all of Licensee's and its User's data, information, and materials that are uploaded by or on behalf of Licensee or that are accessed by Spanning in connection with Licensee's or its User's use of the Software.
1.3. "Documentation" means any documentation distributed by Spanning or its authorized resellers pertaining to the Software, including without limitation any accompanying or online user guides, technical information relating to the Software, user documentation, and technical data sheets in effect on the Effective Date, in each case, as may be updated or amended by or on behalf of Spanning from time to time. Documentation also includes any applicable Order Form and SOW.
1.4. "Fees" means the subscription and other fees set forth in this Agreement or any Order Form or SOW for the purchase of Software licenses, Hardware, or Services.
1.5. "Hardware" has the meaning set forth in Section 10.
1.6. "Licensee's Customers" has the meaning set forth in Section 2.
1.7. "Object Code" means computer programming code in the form not readily perceivable by humans and suitable for machine execution without the intervening steps of interpretation or compilation.

1.8. "Order Form" means any Spanning form detailing an order which is incorporated into and becomes a part of this Agreement. Depending on the Software ordered, the Order Form may be completed online or may take the form of a written order form, invoice, quote, billing statement, or SOW. In the event of any discrepancy between this Agreement and an Order Form, this Agreement shall govern.
1.9. "Professional Services" means implementation and other services requested by Licensee with respect to the Software or the Service.
1.10. "Service" means the use of the Software as offered by Spanning on a hosted basis.
1.11. "Software" means the Object Code form of the Spanning software licensed under this Agreement, including any updates, upgrades, or other modifications thereof delivered or made accessible to Licensee as part of the Services or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement.
1.12. "SOW" means a Spanning-originated, mutually executed statement of work, work order, or other similar document that references this Agreement and which, upon its mutual execution by Licensor and Licensee, will be automatically incorporated by reference into, and governed under, this Agreement.
1.13. "Term" has the meaning set forth in Section 12.1.
1.14. "Third Party Materials" means software, interfaces, and firmware, licensed by Spanning from third parties and which are incorporated into and/or distributed as part of the Software.
1.15. "User" means an individual who is authorized by Licensee to use the Software within its organization or, if applicable, within a multi-tenant or managed services environment, and to whom Licensee has supplied a user identification and password. Users may include, for example, Licensee's employees, consultants and contractors.
2. Grant of Limited License (the "License"). Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including any restrictions set forth in the applicable Order Form and the payment of Fees in accordance with the applicable Order From, Spanning grants Licensee during the Term, a non-sublicensable, nonexclusive, revocable, nontransferable right to use the Software in Object Code as provided by Spanning or the Service as made available by Spanning, for the number of authorized Users (or "Seats") as specified on the applicable Order Form. Such use shall be limited to authorized Users, shall not exceed the number of purchased Seats, and shall be used for Licensee's internal business purposes only. If the Software is authorized to be used in a multi-tenant environment or as part of a managed services solution (a "Managed Service"), then Licensee hereby agrees that the Software will be used solely in furtherance of Licensee's provision of the Managed Service and not for any other purpose by any unauthorized third party and, if required by Spanning from time to time in Spanning's sole discretion, each User shall accept the terms of an end user license agreement for the Software.
Except for one copy made solely for back-up or test purposes with respect to on-premises Licenses, Licensee may deploy or possess only the number of copies of the Software as expressly specified on the Order Form, and only in accordance with the applicable Documentation; otherwise, Licensee shall not copy or distribute the Software, the Documentation or any other written materials accompanying the Software. Licensee will be responsible for ensuring that any and all use of the Software by its Users, MSPs and customers is permitted by this Agreement. The Software licensed or the Service provided hereunder is licensed or provided, as applicable, solely for use in connection with Licensee's internal business requirements, or the provision of any permitted MSP services provided by Licensee to its customers (the "Licensee's Customers") and may not be used for any other purpose, and any and all such uses shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to Licensee.
3. Restrictions. Licensee will not remove, alter, or obscure proprietary notices that appear on or in the Software and

Documentation, and will reproduce them on or in any copies. Licensee will not (and will not allow any User or other third party, including Licensee's Customers, to) (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse compile, or reverse engineer or attempt to discover any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of any Software (except to the extent that applicable law prohibits such restrictions), (ii) modify, or create derivative works based on the Software (iii) provide, sell, give, rent, lease, lend, loan, distribute, transfer, use for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use or allow others to use the Software for the benefit of any third party (except to the extent that the Software forms part of the services being provided by Licensee to Licensee's Customers), (iv) use any Software, or allow the transfer, transmission, export, or re-export of any Software or portion thereof, in violation of any U.S. or any other applicable export control laws or regulations, (v) develop keys or license codes other than license keys provided by Spanning for the Software or attempt to defeat or circumvent any such keys or any other access restrictions included in the Software or determine how any such keys are developed, or (vi) use or copy the Software except as expressly permitted in Section 2. All the limitations and restrictions on Software in this Agreement also apply to Documentation.
4. Usage Limits. Licensee's usage of the Software is subject to usage limits, including, for example, the quantities specified in an Order Form. Unless otherwise specified, (a) a quantity in an Order Form may refer to sets, users, devices, storage or other metrics as applicable to the Software or Service, and such usage of the Software or Service may not exceed the applicable usage metric, (b) a User's password may not be shared with any other User or person, or used simultaneously with multiple instances of the Software, and (c) a User identification may be reassigned to a new individual replacing one who no longer requires use of the Software or Service. If Licensee exceeds a contractual usage limit ("Excessive Use"), Spanning shall give notice to Licensee of any Excessive Use by Licensee ("Excessive Use Notice"). If Licensee fails to cure any Excessive Use within five (5) days of the date of receipt of an Excessive Use Notice, Licensee shall promptly execute an Order Form and pay for additional quantities of the applicable Software promptly upon Spanning's request, and/or pay any invoice for excess usage in accordance with the payment terms and pricing set forth in this Agreement and any Order Form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any event Spanning reserves the right to suspend the Services for any Excessive Use by Licensee.
4.1. APPLICABLE TO ALL LICENSEES: Spanning does not impose any pre-set limits on the amount of storage capacity Users are allowed to consume; however, it is Excessive Use if at any time the cost of Licensee's Users' storage consumption far exceeds the Fees for the Services as calculated by Spanning.
4.2. APPLICABLE TO SPANNING FOR MSP LICENSEES ONLY: IF LICENSEE IS NOT A "SPANNING FOR MSP" CUSTOMER, THIS SECTION IS NOT APPLICABLE TO LICENSEE. For any license or licenses of Licensee, storage of more than ten (10) gigabytes of Customer Data per license for a period of two (2) consecutive months or longer is Excessive Use.
5. Responsibilities. Licensee will (a) be responsible for its Users' compliance with this Agreement, (b) be responsible for the accuracy, quality and legality of Customer Data and the means by which Licensee acquires and uses any Customer Data, (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Software, Services and Customer Data, and notify Spanning promptly of any such unauthorized access or use, (d) use the Software only in accordance with its Documentation and applicable laws and government regulations, and (e) comply with terms of service of Spanning as published from time to time on Spanning's website(s), which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
6. Third Party Materials. Some Third Party Materials may be subject to other terms and conditions, which may be found in a "Read Me" or "About" or similar file in the Software or Software documentation. If Licensee does not agree to such terms, Licensee agrees not to use the Software or any Third Party Materials.
7. Customer Data. Licensee hereby grants to Spanning a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid, transferable license to host, cache, record, copy, view, and display Customer Data for the purpose of providing the Software and Services to Licensee: (a) internal use by Spanning and its affiliates; (b) any purpose related to the billing, activation,

provision, maintenance, upgrades, updates, deactivation and/or use of the Service or the Software and/or related products and/or services; (c) any purposes permitted by any applicable law. Except as set forth in this Agreement, as between Spanning and Licensee, Licensee retains all right, title, and interest in and to Customer Data. Licensee shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and right to use Customer Data, and Licensee agrees that, except for Spanning's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Spanning shall not be responsible or liable for the unauthorized access to, alteration of, or deletion, correction, destruction, corruption, damage, loss or failure to secure or store Customer Data. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it bears sole responsibility for adequately controlling, processing, storing and backing up its Customer Data. Spanning reserves the right, but the obligation, to refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that Spanning believes to be unacceptable, undesirable, or in violation of this Agreement or the rights of third parties. Licensee represents, warrants, and covenant that: (a) it is the owner or authorized licensee of Customer Data and has the right to grant the rights set forth herein; (b) it has obtained all consents necessary under applicable law to disclose Customer Data to Spanning; and (c) it will not publish, post, upload, record, or otherwise distribute or transmit any data or other material that: (i) infringes or would infringe any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right of any party, or any rights of publicity or privacy of any party; (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation; (iii) is inappropriate, profane, defamatory, libelous, obscene, indecent, threatening, harassing, or otherwise unlawful; (iv) is harmful to minors or otherwise pornographic; (v) contains any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, corrupted files, or any other similar software, data, or programs that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, data, Personal Information, or property of another; (vi) is materially false, misleading, or inaccurate; and/or (vii) contains information for which Licensee does not have the right to permit Spanning to access and process any Customer Data.
8. Support and Maintenance. While the license for Software remains effective and the applicable fees have been paid in accordance with this Agreement, Spanning or any of its affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Licensee with the support and maintenance services for the Software or the Service as described in Spanning's then-current support and maintenance program, a copy of which is located on Spanning's web site ("Support Services"). Spanning may elect to change the fees for and the terms of its Support Services or terminate Support Services for the Software or the Service.
9. Proprietary Rights. The Software is licensed, not sold, to Licensee. Similarly, the Services are provided on a subscription basis only, and are not sold to Licensee. Spanning and its affiliates, suppliers and licensors own and retain all right, title and interest in and to: (a) the Software, Service, and Documentation (including all copies, components thereof and all upgrades, modifications, enhancements and derivative works thereof); and, (b) all copyrights, patent rights, trade secret rights, trademark and other intellectual property and other proprietary rights embodied in or relating to the Software, Service or Documentation. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it shall have no rights with respect to any of the foregoing other than the limited rights expressly set forth in this Agreement. Spanning expressly reserves all rights in the Software, Service and Documentation not specifically granted to Licensee. It is acknowledged that all right, title and interest in and to the Software, Service and Documentation will remain vested exclusively with Spanning.
10. Hardware. Delivery to Customer of any hardware and software pre-installed on the hardware (together, the "Hardware") shall be made FCA (Incoterms 2010) our or our affiliate's or subcontractor's designated facility in Libertyville, IL or Canton, MA or any other location as designated by us from time to time or according to the applicable trade term specified on the Order Form. Risk of loss or damage to such hardware and pre-installed Software and title to any such Hardware shall pass to Customer upon delivery.
11. Fees and Payment.
11.1. Payment Terms. Licensee shall pay to Spanning the Fees due for the Software in accordance with terms of this Agreement and any applicable Order Form. Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (a) fees are based on Software licensed and Services purchased and not actual usage, (b) all payment obligations under this

Agreement are non-cancelable and non-refundable, and (c) quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant subscription term. Any payments more than thirty (30) days overdue will bear a late payment fee of 2.0% per month, or, if lower, the maximum rate allowed by law. All amounts payable by Licensee are exclusive of any taxes, fees, duties, shipping, or other charges, however designated, now or hereafter levied. Licensee will be responsible for all taxes (other than Spanning income taxes), fees, duties, shipping or other such charges under this Agreement. Licensee agrees to be responsible for payment for all activity by third parties who access or use the Software through Licensee's account regardless of whether such activity was authorized by Licensee or not. Licensee is responsible for all incidental charges related to using the Software such as charges for Internet access, third party software licenses, text messaging, or other data transmission.
11.2. Payment method; Credit Card Authorization. Until all amounts due have been paid in full, Licensee agrees to keep its payment information current at all times and authorizes Spanning to charge such payment method (including but not limited to credit card, debit card, wire transfer and/or automated clearing house) provided by Licensee, all amounts due under this Agreement, including without limitation, usage beyond the amount specified in the applicable Order Form. All prices are given and must be paid in the currency listed on the applicable Order Form.
11.3. Invoicing. Spanning may invoice Licensee electronically or by paper invoice. Licensee must notify Spanning within ninety (90) days of the receipt of the invoice of any billing errors thereon. If Licensee does not notify Spanning within this time, Spanning will not be required to correct the error and/or make adjustments to Licensee's account and Licensee hereby waives any claim, allegation or contention with respect to such invoice.
12. Term; Termination; Suspension.
12.1. Term. The Licensee will be bound for the entire Term of this Agreement. "Term" is defined as the period of time beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the date set forth in the Order Form, or, if later, the expiration date of any SOW. If the Order Form does not contain a termination date, the Term shall be deemed to end on the later of the three-year anniversary of the Effective Date and the expiration date of any SOW. Except as otherwise specified in an Order Form, at the end of any Term, subscriptions will automatically renew for additional Terms equal to the greater of the expiring Term length or three (3) years, unless either party gives the other party notice of non-renewal at least 30 days and no more than 60 days before the end of the relevant Term. Except as otherwise specified in an Order Form, pricing during any automatic renewal Term will be the same as that during the immediately preceding Term plus an increase not to exceed five percent (5%) plus any increase in the Consumer Price Index published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics during the immediately prior year, in Spanning's sole discretion.
12.2. Termination; Suspension. This Agreement and all rights and licenses granted hereunder will automatically terminate upon the earlier of (a) the date that is thirty (30) days following a party's receipt of written notice of any material breach delivered by either party to the other party provided that any such breach remains uncured at the end of such notice period or immediately in the case of any breach of Sections 2 or 3 by Licensee and (b) the end of a Term that is not renewed. Furthermore, and without derogating from any rights or remedies of Spanning, Spanning shall be entitled to suspend any Service and the use of the Software by Licensee should Licensee breach any term of this Agreement, including without limitation failing to pay any amounts due in a timely manner, or if continued provision of Services poses a risk to Spanning in its sole discretion. Upon termination of this Agreement, or if the license ceases to be effective, Licensee shall immediately cease all use of all Software and Documentation and return or (upon Spanning's request) destroy all copies of all Software and Documentation and all portions thereof and so certify in writing to Spanning and immediately pay all amounts due to Spanning hereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the terms of Sections 2, 11, 13, 15 and 16 shall survive any termination or non-renewal of this Agreement. Termination is not an exclusive remedy and all other remedies available under applicable law or in equity will be available to Spanning whether or not termination occurs.
13. Indemnification.

13.1. Spanning Indemnification. Spanning shall defend Licensee against any third party claims that the Software infringes any United States patent or United States copyright or misappropriates any trade secret (to the extent it qualifies as a trade secret under New York law), and pay any costs and damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed upon in settlement with respect to such claims, provided Spanning is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims and proceedings related thereto and given reasonable assistance and sole control over defense and settlement. Spanning will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing. The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to Software or portions or components thereof (a) not supplied by Spanning, (bi) made in whole or in part in accordance to Licensee's specifications, (c) that are modified after delivery by Spanning, (d) combined with other products, processes or materials where the alleged infringement relates to such combination, (e) where Licensee continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (f) where Licensee's use of the Software is not strictly in accordance with this Agreement or with the Documentation.
13.2. Licensee Indemnification. Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each of Spanning, its affiliates and respective officers, employees, consultants, shareholders and representative from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, and/or costs (including attorneys' and expert witness fees, costs and other expenses) arising out of or related to: (a) any actual or alleged violation of this Agreement or applicable law, rule or regulation by Licensee or any person accessing or using the Software or services by or through Licensee; (b) any actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation by Licensee, or any person accessing or using the Software by or through Licensee, of any intellectual property or privacy or other right of any person or entity (except claims of infringement or misappropriation arising solely from use of the Software as provided under this Agreement); (c) any claims by any of Licensee Customers (except claims of infringement or misappropriation arising solely from use of the Software as provided under this Agreement), or arising out of or relating to Licensee's relationship with any of Licensee Customers; or (d) Customer Data.
14. Limited Warranty and Disclaimer. Spanning warrants to Licensee for a period of thirty (30) days from Licensee's first use of the Software (the "Warranty Period") that the Software will operate substantially pursuant to the Documentation for the Software. This warranty covers only problems reported to Spanning in writing during the Warranty Period, and which are capable of being observed or reproduced by Spanning. SOFTWARE OR ANY PART THEREOF WHICH HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO ABUSE, MISUSE, ACCIDENT, ALTERATION, MODIFICATION, NEGLECT, OR UNAUTHORIZED REPAIR OR INSTALLATION IS NOT COVERED BY THIS WARRANTY. ANY LIABILITY OF SPANNING UNDER THIS WARRANTY WILL BE LIMITED EXCLUSIVELY TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE OR, IF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT IS INADEQUATE AS A REMEDY OR, AT SPANNING'S DETERMINATION, IMPRACTICAL, TO REFUND OF THE LICENSE FEE PAID FOR SUCH SOFTWARE. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING, ALL SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. FURTHER, SPANNING DOES NOT WARRANT RESULTS OF USE, THAT THE SOFTWARE IS BUG FREE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL PROVIDE ANY PROTECTION AGAINST VIRUSES OR ANY NETWORK INTRUSION OR SECURITY BREACH, OR THAT THE USE OF SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. THE SOFTWARE AND/OR SERVICE ARE NOT FAULT TOLERANT AND ARE NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE IN LIFE-DEPENDENT OR HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY OR PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. TO THE EXTENT LICENSEE USES THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE IN SUCH ENVIRONMENT, IT EXPRESSLY ASSUMES ALL RISK THEREFOR.

16. Miscellaneous.
16.1. Licensee Representations. Licensee represents and warrants that: (a) the individual signing or accepting this Agreement has all necessary corporate or other authority to bind the entity that it purports to make party hereto, (b) Licensee has all necessary corporate or other authority or licenses to perform its obligations hereunder.
16.2. Confidentiality. Each party agrees to hold the other party's Confidential Information in confidence and not to use it for any purpose other than the purposes permitted under this Agreement. Each party agrees to use the same standard of care to protect Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own similar confidential and proprietary information, but not less than a reasonable standard of care. The terms of this Agreement constitute Confidential Information. Confidential Information of the other party may only be disclosed to those Affiliates, employees, contractors and advisors of Company or of Spanning, as applicable, on a need-to-know basis and who agree to be bound by confidentiality restrictions at least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement; provided, that nothing shall prevent or prohibit a party from using or disclosing Confidential Information as may be required by law, rule, regulation or legal process. Confidential Information remains at all times the property of the disclosing party. Unless otherwise explicitly set forth herein, no licenses or rights under any patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret are granted or are to be implied with respect to Confidential Information. Spanning may identify Licensee as a customer when referring to lists of customers. Furthermore, Spanning may automatically extract and use Licensee's data and information internally for the limited use of its research and analysis as may be necessary to enhance and improve the software and services it provides to its customers, provided always that any such retained data or information of Licensee shall be for internal use only and shall be used in a de-identified manner only.
16.3. Monitoring; Auditing. Licensee understands that the Software is programmed to track the number of deployed copies of the Software, authorized devices, users and other usage related data, and Licensee consents to such operations and shall not engage in any activity designed to circumvent or obstruct, or which has the effect of circumventing or obstructing, the Software's tracking capabilities. Licensee grants to Spanning the right to monitor usage by all of its users and to audit its books, records and accounts, at Spanning's expense, during Licensee's normal business hours to verify compliance with this Agreement, and Licensee agrees to make available to Spanning or its representatives any records pertaining to this Agreement. If any audit reveals that any additional amounts are owed in excess of five percent (5%) of the total Fees paid during the audited time period, then such owed amounts will be paid immediately and the cost of such audit shall be reimbursed by Licensee. Furthermore, in the event that Licensee uses any Software other than as licensed under this Agreement (or under another agreement executed by the parties), in addition to any other remedies available to Spanning, Licensee agrees to pay Spanning the then current subscription Fees and any related Service fees for such unauthorized use.
16.4. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor the rights and licenses granted hereunder are assignable or transferable by Licensee without the prior written consent of Spanning; any attempt to do so shall be null and void ab initio. Spanning may assign this Agreement in whole or in part.

16.5. Notices and Electronic Communications. Spanning may give notice by means of a general notice on the Software, electronic mail to Licensee's e-mail address on record in Spanning's account information, or by written communication sent by first class mail or pre-paid post to Licensee's address on record in Spanning's account information. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given 48 hours after delivery by first class mail or pre-paid post or 12 hours after sending by email. Licensee shall give notice to Spanning (such notice shall be deemed given when received by Spanning) by confirmed mail delivery to its office at 26 West 17th Street, 9th Floor, New York, New York 10011, Attn: General Counsel.

16.6. Compliance With Laws and Export Control. Licensee shall abide by all applicable local, state, national and foreign laws, rules, treaties and regulations in connection with its use of the Software, including those related to data privacy, international communications and the transmission of technical or personal data. Licensee acknowledges that Spanning may discontinue provision or performance of the Software or Services or terminate the license to the Software granted hereunder following any changes in any relevant applicable law, which in the sole discretion of Spanning, makes performance impossible, or illegal. Licensee further acknowledges that the Software and related technology and technical data (collectively "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported, including U.S Export Administration Regulations. Licensee agrees not to export, re-export, import or provide any Controlled Technology to any prohibited country (such as embargoed countries), entity, or person (such as designated nationals) for which a license or other governmental approval is required or is otherwise prohibited. All Controlled Technology is prohibited for export or re-export to prohibited countries as listed at: http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx or to any country subject to similar trade sanctions. Licensee further agrees that it will not use, export or sell any Controlled Technology for use in connection with chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons, or missiles, drones or space launch vehicles capable of delivering such weapons.

16.7. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction, and any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York. The 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and its related instruments will not apply to this Agreement. This choice of jurisdiction and venue does not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in connection with any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement or enforcement or recognition of any award or order in any appropriate jurisdiction. In addition, the parties agree that they may only bring claims against the other in their individual capacities and not as a plaintiff, class representative or member in any purported class or representative proceeding. The parties hereby agree that each is waiving all respective rights to a trial by jury regarding any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software. Any claim by either party arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought no later than two (2) years after it has accrued. If Spanning commences litigation in connection with this Agreement, it will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses.

16.8. Government End Users. The Software and Documentation are comprised of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and are provided to any civilian or military branch or agency of the U.S. government in accordance with the policies set forth in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 or 28 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3, respectively.

16.9. Remedies. Licensee acknowledges that the Software contains valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of Spanning and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws and treaties and by international copyright law and that any actual or threatened breach of the licenses granted herein will (a) constitute infringement or misappropriation of Spanning's intellectual property rights and (b) cause immediate, irreparable harm to Spanning for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy and for which injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy, in addition to any other remedy available to Spanning.

16.10.

Entire Agreement; Severability. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, this Agreement

is the entire agreement between Spanning and Licensee regarding Licensee's use of the Software, and supersedes and replaces any previous communications, representations, or agreements, or Licensee's additional or inconsistent terms, whether oral or written. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable the remainder of the Agreement will remain enforceable and unaffected thereby. This Agreement may not be modified nor any rights under it waived, in whole or in part, except in writing, signed by both parties.

16.11.

Force Majeure. Each party's obligation (other than Licensee's obligation to pay Fees when due) shall be

suspended during any period that the party is rendered incapable of performing by virtue of any criminal acts of third

parties, war, viruses, acts of public enemies, severe weather conditions, utility failures, strikes or other labor

disturbances, fires, floods, other natural disasters, other acts of God, unforeseeable acts of employees,

telecommunication or interruption of Internet service, or any causes of like or different kind beyond any reasonable

control of the party.

16.12.

Waiver. The failure of either party to insist in any instance upon any payment or performance when due by

the other party, shall not relieve such other party of any of its obligations with respect to such performance, or

constitute a waiver of such party's right to insist upon the full and timely performance in the future of any of the other

party's obligations under this Agreement.

16.13.

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original.

This Agreement is intended for the sole and exclusive benefit of the signatories and is not intended to benefit any

third party.

The parties have caused this Agreement to duly authorized, executed and delivered as of the Effective Date.

If any part of this EULA is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to maintain the intent of this EULA, and the other
parts will remain in full force and effect. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to the SOFTWARE or this EULA. Furthermore, this EULA will not be governed or interpreted in any way by referring to any law based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any other act derived from or related to UCITA.
BINDING ARBITRATION ANY "DISPUTE" THAT IS NOT RESOLVED THROUGH THE INFORMAL NEGOTIATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION. "DISPUTE" is defined as any disagreement, cause of action, claim, controversy, or proceeding between you and any Sony entity related to or arising out of the SOFTWARE or this EULA. DISPUTE is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If a DISPUTE arises, you agree to first give notice to SONY by contacting Sony Electronics Inc. at 16535 Via Esprillo, MZ 1105, San Diego, CA 92127, Attn: Legal Department, and engaging in good faith negotiations to attempt to resolve any DISPUTE for at least 14 days, except that you or Sony (or any of its affiliates) may skip this informal negotiation procedure for DISPUTE enforcing, protecting, or concerning the validity of intellectual property rights.

ARBITRATION INSTRUCTIONS To begin arbitration, either you or SONY must make a written demand to the other for arbitration. The arbitration will take place before a single arbitrator. It will be administered in keeping with the Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the Supplementary Proceedings for Consumer-Related disputes when applicable ("Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in effect when the claim is filed. You may get a copy of AAA's Rules by contacting AAA at (800) 778-7879 or visiting www.adr.org. The filing fees to begin and carry out arbitration will be shared between you and SONY, but in no event shall your fees ever exceed the amount allowable by the special rules for Consumers Disputes provided for by AAA, at which point SONY will cover all additional administrative fees and expenses. This does not prohibit the arbitrator from giving the winning party their fees and expenses of the arbitration when appropriate pursuant to the Rules. Unless you and SONY agree differently, the arbitration will take place in the county and state where you live, and applicable federal or state law shall govern the substance of any DISPUTE. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., will govern the arbitration itself and not any state law on arbitration. The arbitrator's decision will be binding and final, except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the party seeking relief, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's decision.
SMALL CLAIMS EXCEPTION Despite the provisions set forth above, you have the right to litigate any DISPUTE in small claims court or other similar court of limited jurisdiction, to the extent the amount at issue does not exceed $15,000, and as long as such court has proper jurisdiction and all other requirements (including amount in controversy) are satisfied.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ANY DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND BOTH PARTIES AGREE NOT TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS ALL PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE DISPUTE SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION.

OPT-OUT INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION AND/OR THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER ABOVE, THEN: (1) YOU MUST NOTIFY SONY IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST USE THE SOFTWARE OR AGREE TO THIS EULA, WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST; (2) YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO SONY ELECTRONICS INC., 16535 VIA ESPRILLO, MZ 1105, SAN DIEGO CA 92127, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT; AND (3) YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST INCLUDE: (A) YOUR NAME; (B) YOUR ADDRESS; (C) THE DATE YOU FIRST USED THE SOFTWARE OR AGREED TO THIS EULA; AND (D) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ANY SONY ENTITY THROUGH ARBITRATION AND/OR TO BE BOUND BY THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
REJECTING CHANGES MADE TO THE DISPUTE PROCEDURES Despite anything to the contrary in this EULA, you may reject changes made to the binding arbitration provision and class action waiver if: (1) you've already begun authorized use of the SOFTWARE at the time the change was/is made; and (2) you mail written notice to the address in the immediately preceding paragraph within 30 days after the particular change was/is made. Should such a situation arise, you will still be bound by the DISPUTE procedures you previously agreed to and existing before the change you rejected was made.
MISCELLANEOUS Any DISPUTE determined not subject to arbitration and not initiated in small claims court will be litigated by either party in a court of competent jurisdiction in either the superior court for the County of San Diego or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.
EQUITABLE REMEDIES Notwithstanding anything contained in this EULA to the contrary, you acknowledge and agree that any violation of or non-compliance with this EULA by you will cause irreparable harm to SONY, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to SONY obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that SONY deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. SONY may also take any legal and technical remedies to prevent violation of and/or to enforce this EULA, including, but not limited to, immediate termination of your use of the SOFTWARE, if SONY believes in its sole discretion that you are violating or intend to violate this EULA. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies SONY may have at law, in equity or under contract.

TERMINATION Without prejudice to any of its other rights, SONY may terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with any of its terms. In case of such termination, you must: (i) cease all use, and destroy any copies, of the SOFTWARE; (ii) comply with the requirements in the section below entitled "Your Account Responsibilities".
AMENDMENT SONY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AMEND ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS EULA AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION BY POSTING NOTICE ON A SONY DESIGNATED WEB SITE, BY EMAIL NOTIFICATION TO AN EMAIL ADDRESS PROVIDED BY YOU, BY PROVIDING NOTICE AS PART OF THE PROCESS IN WHICH YOU OBTAIN UPGRADES/UPDATES OR BY ANY OTHER LEGALLY RECOGNIZABLE FORM OF NOTICE. If you do not agree to the amendment, you should promptly contact SONY for instructions. Your continued use of the SOFTWARE after the effective date of any such notice shall be deemed your agreement to be bound by such amendment.
THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES Each THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIER is an express intended third-party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, each provision of this EULA with respect to the SOFTWARE of such party.
YOUR ACCOUNT RESPONSIBILITIES Should you return your DEVICE to its place of purchase, sell or otherwise transfer your DEVICE, or if this EULA is terminated, you are responsible for and must uninstall the SOFTWARE from the DEVICE and delete any and all accounts you may have established on DEVICE or are accessible through the SOFTWARE. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any accounts you have with SONY or third parties and any usernames and passwords associated with your use of the DEVICE.
Should you have any questions concerning this EULA, you may contact SONY by writing to SONY at: Sony Electronics Inc., 16535 Via Esprillo, San Diego, CA 92127.

WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.

5.1. Hardware Warranty.

5.2. Software Warranty. Subject to this Section 5, Pure warrants that the Software will perform in substantial accordance with the corresponding Product documentation for 90 days from the date of shipment by Pure.

If a return is required, End User must obtain a return material authorization number from Pure and return the Product in secure packaging, freight prepaid, as instructed by Pure. Under the hardware warranty, Pure, at its option, either (i) will repair or replace any defective Product with Product or components of equal or greater functionality as the returned Product, or (ii) will refund the purchase price paid to Pure for such Product, reduced on a straight-line basis over a three-year life. Replacement Products or components will continue to be warranted for the remainder of the applicable warranty term. Repair, replacement or refund is the sole and exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty. Under the Software warranty, Pure will provide End User access to bug fixes and emergency patches.

6.

INDEMNIFICATION. Pure will indemnify and defend End

User, at Pure's expense, against any action brought by a third party

against End User to the extent that the action is based upon a claim

that the Products directly infringe any copyrights or U.S. patents or

misappropriate any trade secrets, and Pure will pay those costs

and damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction

against End User in any such action that are specifically

attributable to such claim or those costs and damages agreed to

by Pure in a monetary settlement of such action. If End User's use

of the Product is, or in Pure's opinion is likely to become, enjoined

as a result of an infringement claim, Pure will, at its option and

expense, either (i) procure the right to continue using the Product;

(ii) replace or modify the Product so that it becomes non-infringing

and remains functionally equivalent; or (iii) if, despite its

commercially reasonable efforts, Pure is unable to do either (i) or

(ii), Pure will accept return of the Product, terminate the rights

herein, and pay to End User a prorated refund of the money paid

to Pure for the purchase of such Product reduced on a straight-line

basis over a three-year life. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pure

will have no obligation with respect to any infringement claim

based upon (a) any use of the Product that is not in accordance

with this Agreement or the corresponding Product

documentation; (b) any use of the Product in combination

with other products, equipment, software, or data not

supplied by Pure if such infringement would not have arisen

but for such combination; (c) the use of any release of the

Software other than the current and immediately preceding

version; or (d) any modification of the Product by any person

other than Pure if such infringement would not have arisen but

for such modification. This Section 6 states Pure's entire liability,

and End User's sole and exclusive remedy, for infringement claims

and actions. The foregoing obligations are subject to End User

notifying Pure promptly in writing of such action, giving Pure

sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement

negotiations, and cooperating and assisting in such defense at

Pure's reasonable request and expense (including reasonable

attorneys' fees).

7.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL

PURE, ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND THEIR

RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS AND

EMPLOYEES NOR ITS SUPPLIERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE

"PURE PARTIES") BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,

CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT

DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST OR CORRUPTED

DATA, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS ARISING IN

CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE PRODUCT OR

SERVICES OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER CLAIM

ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE PURE

PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is expressly understood by the parties that Pure does not host or have read or write access to the End User data stored by End User on the Products.

Recipient shall: (i) not use or disclose any Confidential Information except as expressly authorized by this Agreement or Discloser; (ii) protect Discloser's Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it uses with respect to its own confidential information of a like nature, but in no event with safeguards less than a reasonably prudent business would exercise under similar circumstances; and (iii) limit access to Discloser's Confidential Information to its employees, affiliates, agents, or authorized representatives having a need to know and who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective to those contained herein. Recipient shall take prompt and appropriate action to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information. Recipient's obligations under this Section 9.2 survive termination and continue for five (5) years from the date of termination of this Agreement. All tangible materials containing Confidential Information shall remain the property of Discloser. Upon termination, Recipient shall cease any use of Confidential Information. Upon Discloser's written request, the receiving party shall promptly return (or at Discloser's option, destroy) all documents and tangible materials containing any portion of, or summarizing, Discloser's Confidential Information. At Discloser's request, an authorized representative of Recipient shall provide a certificate attesting to compliance with this section. If any Confidential Information must be disclosed to any third party

by reason of legal, accounting, or regulatory requirements, Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser of the order or request and permit Discloser (at its own expense) to seek an appropriate protective order.

and

hereinafter called AIRBUS Defence

and Space

END USER

Under the terms and conditions of this End User License Agreement (EULA), AIRBUS Defence and Space grants to the END USER a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use TerraSAR-X data and any derived products.
This license is applicable to all TerraSAR-X data and any derived products, except Derivative Works. For the purposes of this Agreement, Derivative Works refers to any products or information, developed by the END USER, from the TerraSAR-X data as well as any products created from TerraSAR-X data but which do not contain any original imagery data in an "as-is" format. It also refers to any products which are irreversible and uncoupled from the source data and in which the TerraSAR-X origin is not recognizable. Digital Elevation Models (DEM) extracted from TerraSAR-X data (in any form whatsoever, i.e. databases) will be considered as derived products and not as Derivative Works.
END USER means either the person, acting in his own name, or the organization, which is supplied with the product and accepts this EULA. When the product is supplied to a public entity (civil agency, public department) the END USER shall be deemed to be only such part of the public entity as located at the address to which the product is supplied, except upon prior written agreement from AIRBUS Defence and Space.
In accordance with AIRBUS Defence and Space licensing and pricing structure, this EULA applies to all TerraSAR-X data and any derived products (except Derivative Works) purchased by the END USER. This license permits use of the TerraSAR-X data and any derived products by one person/organization as identified by the END USER at the time of purchase.

1. LICENSE
All TerraSAR-X data is property of the Federal Republic of Germany represented by the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft-und Raumfahrt e. V. (DLR) and subject to the "Satellite Data Security Act (SatDSiG)". Therefore the END USER shall only be granted non-exclusive rights to use TerraSAR-X data and any derived products according to this EULA; this point must be acknowledged before any use.

1.1 Permitted Rights:
a) to install the TerraSAR-X data and any derived products on as many individual computers as
needed in its premises, including internal computer network;
b) to use the TerraSAR-X data and any derived products only for its own internal needs;

Status 11/2017

c) to alter or modify delivered TerraSAR-X data and any derived products by himself or his
contractor(s). The END USER has to inform AIRBUS Defence and Space in advance about the contractor(s) and shall ensure that his contractor(s) will use TerraSAR-X data and any derived products only for the purpose of the contract given by the END USER, and shall keep no copy of any and all TerraSAR-X data, any derived products and the altered and/or modified TerraSAR-X data and any derived products upon completion of the contract given by the END USER.
d) to publish TerraSAR-X data, any derived products and the altered and/or modified TerraSAR-X
data and any derived products as hardcopy prints and in presentations, provided that the END USER conspicuously marks the copyright. Such publishing shall be used for END USER business promotion purposes only.
e) to post derived products as browse images or equivalent (resampled to 20 meters) to internet web
sites after notifying AIRBUS Defence and Space of the URL that will be used, provided that the END USER conspicuously marks the copyright. Such posting shall be used for END USER business promotion purposes only. In no event this Agreement allows downloading of the posting by third parties, nor using to distribute, sell, assign, dispose of, lease, sublicense or transfer such posting.
All permitted rights not expressly granted above are hereby retained by AIRBUS Defence and Space.
1.2 Explicitly Prohibited Uses:
a) to assign the license to third parties or to grant sublicenses;
b) to alter or remove any copyright notice or proprietary legend contained in or on the TerraSAR-X
data and any derived products;
c) to publish, distribute or transfer in any way the digital format of TerraSAR-X data and/or Quicklooks.
2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
TerraSAR-X data delivered to the END USER remains the property of the Federal Republic of Germany represented by the Deutsche Zentrum für Luft-und Raumfahrt e. V. (DLR). TerraSAR-X data and any derived products are the intellectual property of AIRBUS Defence and Space.
AIRBUS Defence and Space affirms that it has been granted an exclusive license to promote, reproduce and sell the right to use TerraSAR-X data and any derived products for commercial purposes and is authorized to grant the sub-license to the END USER in this EULA.
AIRBUS Defence and Space reserves all intellectual property rights not expressly granted to the END USER acc. Art. 1. Any right to sublicensing by the END USER is explicitly excluded from this EULA.
The END USER recognizes AIRBUS Defence and Space's right to copyright protection and/or protection against unauthorized use of the TerraSAR-X data and any derived products, in accordance with the copyright laws of Germany and applicable international agreements.
This License does not give the right to the use of AIRBUS Defence and Space trademarks or logos unless explicitly authorized by AIRBUS Defence and Space.

SOFTWARE LICENSE.

2.1 Software License. Subject to Customer's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Customer's payment of all fees due, Rubrik grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except as may be expressly permitted herein) license to use the Software and Documentation only for Customer's internal business purposes on Hardware or Rubrik-approved third-party hardware and in accordance with the Documentation. Unless otherwise specified in applicable Product Specific Terms, Customer may use the Products for the benefit of its Affiliates, and Affiliates may use the Products for their own benefit, but only in the quantities and capacity as set out in the applicable Order and subject to compliance with all terms of this Agreement. Customer guarantees that each Affiliate will fully perform its obligations hereunder, and Customer is responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Affiliates.

2.2 Term of License. Software is licensed for the time period set forth in the applicable Order and either: (i) on a device basis, meaning Customer's right to use the Software is tied to the life of the Hardware on which it was originally installed (for clarity, the Software is not portable to new Hardware or third-party hardware) ("Life of Device License"); or (ii) on a subscription basis, meaning Customer has the right to use the Software or SaaS Services for the period of time set forth in the applicable Order and any renewals thereof ("Subscription License").

2.3 Hardware Refresh Policy. Certain Subscription Licenses may be eligible for a Hardware refresh or transfer to replacement Hardware in accordance with Rubrik's then-current Hardware Refresh Policy at https://www.rubrik.com/en/legal, or as otherwise authorized by Rubrik in writing.

2.4 SaaS Services Additional Terms. If Customer acquires SaaS Services, subject to Customer's compliance with this Agreement and payment of all fees due, Rubrik grants Customer the limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the SaaS Services for the Term, solely for Customer's internal business purposes and for the number of users and/or the capacity specified in the applicable Order. Customer is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all usernames and passwords required for use of the SaaS Services and for all activities conducted in connection with the use of such passwords or access to the SaaS Services. Rubrik will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide consistent site availability for the SaaS Services during the Term (excluding scheduled maintenance and downtime, connectivity problems, Customer actions or misuse, or other matters outside Rubrik's reasonable control). Rubrik does not warrant or guarantee uninterrupted availability. Customer's use of the SaaS Services is subject to the Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") at https://www.rubrik.com/en/legal. Rubrik reserves the right to suspend or terminate Customer's use of the SaaS Services if Rubrik becomes aware that Customer or any of its users use the SaaS Services in violation of the AUP, a material term of this Agreement, or any applicable law or regulations. Rubrik may also impose temporary limits on certain features and services or temporarily restrict Customer's access to parts of the SaaS Services for maintenance, support or system administration purposes without notice or liability. Rubrik agrees to provide commercially reasonable notice under the circumstances of any such suspension before its implementation. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, and legality, of all Customer data stored or uploaded to the SaaS Services. Upon the termination of this Agreement or expiration of the Term, Customer will have no further rights to access the SaaS Services hereunder. For a period of thirty (30) days after such termination or expiration, upon Customer's prior written request, Rubrik will allow Customer limited access to retrieve any Customer data remaining on the SaaS Services. After such thirty (30) day period, Customer will have no further rights to access the SaaS Services.

2.5 Product Specific Terms; Open Source. Customer acknowledges and agrees that certain Products are subject to different or additional terms ("Product Specific Terms") available at https://www.rubrik.com/en/legal which may apply if purchased by Customer. The Software may contain or be provided with components subject to the terms and conditions of open source software licenses ("Open Source Software"). Nothing in this Agreement limits Customer's rights under, or grants Customer rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable Open Source Software end user license; however, the license to the Software in Section 2.1 (Software License) includes the right to use the Open Source Software incorporated in the Software in the same manner and to the same extent as the Software.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. Software, SaaS Services and Documentation are licensed to Customer and not sold. Rubrik

and its licensors retain all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Software, SaaS Services and

provided in the provision of Support Services. The Software, SaaS Services and Documentation are protected by copyright

and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties. This Agreement does not grant Customer any rights not

expressly granted herein. All trademarks used in connection with the Software, Documentation and SaaS Services are owned

by Rubrik, its affiliates, licensors and other suppliers, and no license to use any such trademarks is provided hereunder.

Customer may elect to provide suggestions, comments for enhancements or functionality, or other feedback to Rubrik with

respect to the Products (including Trial Products), Support Services, and Professional Services ("Feedback"). Customer is not

required to provide Feedback to Rubrik, but if Customer in its sole discretion provides Feedback, Customer hereby grants

Rubrik a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate into its

products and services any Feedback as it sees fit without obligation or restriction of any kind. Customer will not provide any

Feedback subject to any terms that would impose any obligation on or require attribution by Rubrik.

5.

ORDERS; FEES. Customer will purchase Products from a Rubrik authorized reseller pursuant to a separate

agreement between Customer and such reseller ("Partner Agreement"). Customer shall pay the reseller all amounts due and

owing under an Order (along with all taxes, tariffs, and duties) in accordance with the Partner Agreement. The Partner

Agreement is between Customer and the reseller and is not binding on Rubrik. In the event Customer places an Order in a

third-party cloud marketplace in which Rubrik has agreed to participate: (i) Customer is responsible for payment of all fees

(along with all taxes, tariffs, and duties) in accordance with the terms of the Order placed in such cloud marketplace; and (ii)

6.

AUDIT. During the Term and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, Rubrik (or its independent third-party auditors)

has the right to reasonably audit Customer's relevant facilities, systems, and records to confirm Customer's compliance with

this Agreement. Rubrik may conduct no more than one (1) audit per twelve (12) month period and Customer shall reasonably

cooperate with Rubrik (or its independent third-party auditors) for such audit. If an audit discloses Customer has installed,

accessed, used, or otherwise permitted use and access to the Software or SaaS Services in a manner that is not permitted

expressly by this Agreement, Customer agrees to reimburse the applicable channel partner, or Rubrik, promptly for any unpaid

fees (if applicable). In addition, if such audit reveals underpayment or non-compliance in excess of 10% of fees payable by

Customer, Customer agrees to reimburse Rubrik for all of Rubrik's reasonable expenses related to such audit.

7.

TRIAL PRODUCTS.

7.1 Trial Product Use. Rubrik may provide certain Software, SaaS or Hardware products to Customer at no charge specifically for trial purposes ("Trial Products"). Subject to Customer's compliance with this Section 7 (Trial Products), Rubrik grants Customer a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable right to install and use the Trial Products solely for internal, non-commercial evaluation purposes for thirty (30) days from Customer's receipt of the Trial Products, unless otherwise extended by Rubrik in writing in its sole discretion ("Trial Term"). In the event the Trial Products are not yet generally available and provided to Customer in an beta or other pre-release format, Customer acknowledges, as a condition of their use: (i) such Trial Products are under development and not at the level of performance or compatibility of generally available products; (ii) may not operate correctly, may contain errors, bugs, and design flaws; (iii) may be modified by Rubrik prior to being made generally available; (iv) may not be made available for general release; and (v) do not include Support Services. Customer agrees to use reasonable efforts to notify Rubrik of any bugs or problems in the Trial Products.

7.2 Restrictions. Customer will not upload or store Customer Personal Data or Customer Confidential Information into any Trial Product, and Customer will only use the Trial Products with non-production data in a non-production environment. If Customer elects to upload or store production data, Customer assumes all risk in doing so, and Rubrik shall have no liability with regard thereto, including for any loss or corruption of Customer data. Upon expiration or termination of the Trial Term, Customer's right to use the Trial Product ends, and Customer's access to SaaS Services Trial Products will cease. Customer will email returns@rubrik.com for Trial Product return instructions. Customer shall securely delete all Customer data from the Trial Products upon termination or expiry of the Trial Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer is responsible for the Trial Products (except for reasonable wear and tear), until the Trial Products are back within Rubrik's possession and control.

Customer acknowledges that any data remaining on any Trial Product returned to Rubrik may be disposed of or destroyed by Rubrik without any liability to Rubrik. At all times, Rubrik retains title and ownership to the Trial Products. RUBRIK, ITS SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY IN RELATION TO TRIAL PRODUCTS FOR LOSSES, COSTS, OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN EXCESS OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1000).

8.

CONFIDENTIALITY. Customer and Rubrik may disclose Confidential Information to each other during the Term.

"Confidential Information" means all proprietary business and technical information disclosed by one Party ("Disclosing

Party") to the other Party ("Receiving Party") which is in tangible form and labeled "confidential" or the like, or that reasonably

should be understood to be confidential given the circumstances of disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential

Information includes, but is not limited to, the Products, Trial Products, Documentation, strategic roadmaps, product plans,

product designs and architecture, technology and technical information, security processes, security audit reviews and business

and marketing plans. Confidential Information will not include information that: (i) was already in Receiving Party's possession

without confidentiality obligations; (ii) is rightfully received by Receiving Party without confidentiality obligations; (iii) is

independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information;

or (iv) is publicly disclosed by the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party will protect Confidential Information received from the

Disclosing Party using the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own similar confidential materials, but in no event using

less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party will disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, alliance partners

or contractors who have a need to know for purposes of this Agreement and who are under a written obligation of confidentiality

no less protective than this Agreement. Confidential Information may be disclosed in response to a subpoena or order of a court

or governmental agency, provided however, that if not otherwise prohibited, the Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party

promptly of such disclosure to enable the Disclosing Party to seek an appropriate protective order. The Parties' obligations

with respect to Customer Personal Data are set forth in Section 9 (Security; Protection of Personal Data) rather than in this

Section 8 (Confidentiality). Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Receiving Party will, upon

request, return or destroy the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party

may retain such copies of Disclosing Party's Confidential Information stored electronically on data archives or back-up systems

or to comply with the laws or regulations applicable to the Receiving Party, provided that such copies shall at all times be

subject to the terms of this Agreement while in Receiving Party's possession or control.

9.

SECURITY; PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA. During the Term of this Agreement, Rubrik will implement and

maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards and measures designed to address the

security, confidentiality and availability of the Products, Support Services and Professional Services as more fully set forth in

the Data Security Schedule to the Data Processing Addendum ("DPA") available at https://www.rubrik.com/en/legal. Customer

acknowledges and agrees that the DPA will apply to the extent Rubrik is required to process Customer Personal Data in

connection with the SaaS Services, Professional Services and Support Services. Customer must promptly notify Rubrik of any

unauthorized use of or access to the Products purchased by Customer.

10. SUPPORT. Support Services for the Products are covered in the then-current Rubrik Hardware Warranty (if applicable) and Support Services Policy at https://www.rubrik.com/en/legal, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

11. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. Customer may place an Order for Professional Services. Professional Services may be performed by Rubrik or sub-contractors acting on Rubrik's behalf. In regard to Professional Services, Rubrik warrants that: (i) it and each of its employees, consultants and subcontractors, if any, have the necessary knowledge, skills, experience, qualifications and resources to provide and perform the Professional Services; and (ii) the Professional Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with industry standards. Rubrik shall own all rights, title and interest in and to any deliverables provided to Customer and all related intellectual property rights (excluding Customer's Confidential Information), unless otherwise set forth in a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work ("SOW"). Except for those Professional Services with a term specified in an Order or SOW, all training Professional Services must be used within twelve (12) months of the date of the Order, and all other Professional Services must be used within six (6) months of the date of the Order, after which, all unused Professional Services will expire. Orders for Professional Services are not transferable to any other Product or Service. As a condition to Rubrik providing Professional Services hereunder, Customer shall: (a) provide good faith cooperation and access to such information, facilities, and equipment as may be reasonably required in order to provide the Professional Services; and (b) provide such personnel assistance as may be reasonably requested from time to time. If, through no fault or delay by Customer, or any failure by Customer or Customer's representatives to perform in accordance with this Section 11 (Professional Services), the Professional Services do not conform to the foregoing warranty, and Customer notifies Rubrik within ten (10) days of Rubrik's completion of the Professional Services, Rubrik will re-perform the nonconforming portion(s) of the Professional Services at no additional cost to Customer.

Customer's obligation is to provide all information reasonably requested to enable Rubrik to cure the deficiencies.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, TRIAL PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED AND LICENSED TO CUSTOMER ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, AND ALL WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, ARE EXCLUDED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS.
13. INDEMNIFICATION.
13.1 Intellectual Property Indemnification. Rubrik agrees to defend or settle, at Rubrik's option, a third-party claim or cause of action against Customer alleging that the Products infringe or misappropriate a U.S. patent or copyright of such third party ("Claim") and to pay damages finally awarded against Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction or as agreed to in a settlement. Rubrik's obligations hereunder do not apply with respect to any Claim that arises out of: (i) any unauthorized use, reproduction or distribution of the Products; (ii) use of the Products in combination with any other software or equipment not specified by the Documentation if such Claim would have been avoided without such combination; (iii) Products that were modified after delivery without Rubrik's prior written authorization; or (iv) Customer's continued use of the allegedly infringing Product after Rubrik supplied a modified or replacement non-infringing Product. If any Claim arises, Rubrik may, at its sole option and expense: (a) replace or modify the affected Product to make it non-infringing; (b) procure a license for Customer's continued use of the affected Product; or if (a) and (b) are not commercially viable (as determined by Rubrik in its sole discretion), accept return of the affected Products and terminate Customer's rights thereto, in which case Rubrik will process a pro-rated refund for the applicable prepaid unused fees for such Product covering the remainder of the Term via the applicable channel partner. For Life of the Device licensed Software and Hardware, the refund will be based on a straight-line amortization over a three (3) year term beginning on the date of initial delivery of the Software and Hardware. This Section 13.1 (Intellectual Property Indemnity) states Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Rubrik's sole liability, with respect to infringement of intellectual property rights.
13.2 SaaS Services Indemnity. Customer agrees to defend and indemnify Rubrik from and against any loss, damage, or cost arising from a third-party claim that Customer data stored or uploaded into the SaaS Services, or Customer's use of the SaaS Services (i) infringes an intellectual property right or misappropriates a trade secret of a third party; or (ii) violates the AUP or this Agreement.
13.3 Indemnification Process. As a condition of receiving indemnity as described in Section 13 (Indemnification), the party seeking the indemnity will provide the other party with: (i) prompt written notice of the claim, provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure; (ii) complete control over the defense and settlement of the claim (provided that the indemnifying party will not settle any claim without the other party's prior written permission if the settlement fails to

unconditionally release the indemnified party from all liability pertaining to the claim, such permission not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and (iii) reasonable assistance in connection with the defense and settlement of the claim.

14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
14.1 Disclaimer of Consequential Damages. EXCEPT FOR CUSTOMER'S BREACH OF SECTIONS 2.1 (SOFTWARE LICENSE) AND 3 (USE RESTRICTIONS) OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUE, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR THE COST OF COVER, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES. IN SUCH AN EVENT, THIS EXCLUSION WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT THE EXCLUSION IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.
14.2 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL RUBRIK'S, ITS AFFILIATES' AND ITS LICENSORS' TOTAL AND CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO RUBRIK (OR TO THE APPLICABLE CHANNEL PARTNER) FOR THE PRODUCTS IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION DOES NOT LIMIT OR EXCLUDE ANY LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE.

15. TERM AND TERMINATION.
15.1 Term; Termination for Cause. This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues until the end of the Term.

16.10 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, such provision will be limited or eliminated to the extent necessary so that the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
16.11 Nonwaiver. The failure of Customer or Rubrik to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of such provision or of any other provision of this Agreement.
16.12 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement to the extent caused by circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Party including (without limitation) pandemics, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, internet service provider failures or delays, denial of services attacks or other similar causes, war, terrorism, governmental action, labor conditions, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or material shortages.
16.13 Integration; Order of Precedence. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Rubrik and supersedes any and all prior agreements or communications between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof.

This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by a writing that specifically refers to this Agreement and is signed by an authorized representative of both Customer and Rubrik. The terms of this Agreement shall supersede and control over any conflicting or additional terms and conditions of any purchase order, acknowledgement, confirmation or other document issued by or on behalf of Customer, and such documents are of no force or effect. Notwithstanding any agreement Customer may have previously accepted during the installation of any prior versions of the Products, this Agreement applies to the Software, SaaS Terms and any Updates or Upgrades (except to the extent such Updates or Upgrades are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case the different terms apply prospectively and do not alter Customer's or Rubrik's rights relating to pre-updated Software).
16.14 Ambiguities and Notices. Customer and Rubrik have participated in the review of this Agreement. Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party shall not apply in interpreting this

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, CRESTRON, ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE.

8.2    The Software and Documentation are provided to Licensee "as is" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind.  Crestron provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Software will meet the Licensee's requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

8.3    Limitation of Liability.  To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law:

    (a)    IN NO EVENT WILL CRESTRON OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE TO THE LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY USE, INTERRUPTION, DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS, DELAYS, INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, BUSINESS OR GOODWILL, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, LOSS RESULTING FROM SYSTEM OR SYSTEM SERVICE FAILURE, MALFUNCTION OR SHUTDOWN, FAILURE TO ACCURATELY TRANSFER, READ OR TRANSMIT INFORMATION, FAILURE TO UPDATE OR PROVIDE CORRECT INFORMATION, SYSTEM INCOMPATIBILITY OR PROVISION OF INCORRECT COMPATIBILITY INFORMATION OR BREACHES IN SYSTEM SECURITY, OR FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE AND WHETHER OR NOT CRESTRON WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    (b)    IN NO EVENT WILL CRESTRON'S AND ITS AFFILIATES', INCLUDING ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS' AND SERVICE PROVIDERS', COLLECTIVE AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED ONE-HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).

8.4    Interpretation of Warranty Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability .  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided herein cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, a reviewing court shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Software.

Page 3 of 4

exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any legal action arising out of this EULA will be Berlin, Germany.

14. COMPLETE AND BINDING EULA
Subject to any specific terms of an order for Content incorporating this EULA, this EULA constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding between the Parties relating to its subject matter.

The foregoing notwithstanding, each Transaction will require that: i) this EULA be accepted by End User and ii) End User obtains actual or constructive possession of the Software.

3.0 Additional Terms
Nothing contained in this EULA is intended to prohibit or restrict the parties from mutually agreeing to enter into separate terms and conditions that i) modify or supplement the terms and conditions (including business and/or financial terms) of this EULA or the License granted to End User pursuant to this EULA; or ii) create or modify the terms a particular Transaction.

4.0 Evaluation License

Veeam's current Maintenance Policies can be found athttp://www.veeam.com/support.html.
8.0 Copyright and Other Restrictions
The Software is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The Software is licensed, not sold. The Software contains copyrighted material, trade secrets and other proprietary material of Veeam. All right, title and interest in the Software remains at all times with Veeam. In no event will End User directly or indirectly permit the Software to be decompiled, reverse engineered, or disassembled. End User will not disclose, transfer or otherwise make available the Software, or the results of any benchmark or other tests of the Software, to any third party without the prior written consent of Veeam. End User shall not remove any proprietary notices from the Software. End User may make one copy of the Software solely for backup or archival purposes.
9.0 Audit
During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, Veeam may, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to End User, inspect the files, computer processors, equipment and facilities of End User to verify End User's compliance with this EULA.
10.0 Limited Warranty and Limitation of Liability
Veeam warrants that it has the right and authority to grant the License under this EULA. Veeam will defend or, at its option, settle any action against End User based upon a claim that its use of the Software infringes any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of a third party, and will indemnify End User against any amounts awarded against End User as a result of the claim, provided Veeam is promptly notified of the assertion of the claim and has control of its defense or settlement. Veeam warrants that the Software, in its unmodified form as initially delivered or made available to End User, will perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation for a warranty period of ninety (90) days from the date the Software is delivered to End User. In the event the Software fails in a material respect to operate in accordance with the Documentation during the warranty period and Veeam is unable to correct the defect, Veeam's sole and exclusive liability and End User's sole and exclusive remedy shall be a refund of the License fee, if any, paid by End User for the Software. In the event a reported problem with the Software is End User's fault, End User agrees to reimburse Veeam for its correction efforts in accordance with its then standard rates. The foregoing limited warranty will not apply if failure of the Software is the result of damage or misuse caused by End User.
EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT

LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY VEEAM OR ANY THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY VEEAM DISTRIBUTORS OR RESELLERS, SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY IN ADDITION TO, OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF, THE LIMITED WARRANTY.
In no event will Veeam, its affiliates, resellers, or distributors or suppliers be liable for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software, including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility thereof.
11.0 Assignment
Except in the event of a sale or transfer by Veeam of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities, neither party will assign all or any portion of its rights or obligations under this EULA to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party.
12.0 U.S. Government End Users
Use, duplication, or disclosure of the Software to or by the U. S. Government is subject to the provisions and restrictions as set forth in FAR 52.227-14 and FAR 52.227-19, or equivalent restrictions and provisions as set forth in DFAR 252.227-7013 and DFAR 252.227-7014.
13.0 General
This Agreement sets forth Veeam's entire obligation and End User's exclusive rights with respect to the Software and, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided in a purchase order or other written communication or advertising signed or jointly issued by both parties with respect to the Software, supersedes any conflicting terms of any purchase order and any other communication or advertising with respect to the Software. No failure of either party to exercise or enforce any of its rights under this EULA will act as a waiver of those rights. If any provision of this EULA is found illegal or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the legality and enforceability of the other provisions of this EULA will not be affected. This EULA will be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to its choice of law principles. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.
14.0 Export Controls

2. License. (a) Server Software. Subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA, Vocera grants you the non-
exclusive right to (i) install and run ("Use") the Server Software on computer systems (each, a "Server Computer") located at End User's Facilities in the geographic territory designated above ("Territory"); (ii) to Use the Client Software in conjunction with Authorized Client Devices and such Server Computers; and (iii) for pilot licenses for certain Software provided on a trial basis, use such Software for the limited term specified by Vocera in writing. You may Use the standard Server Software on one primary Server Computer (or a primary cluster of computers suitably configured for productive use of the Server Software). You may install backup copies of the Server Software on backup Server Computers to provide redundancy in the event of failure of the primary Server Computer(s) but, unless you have acquired multiple licenses or a failover license from Vocera, you may not run such backup or additional copies concurrently with the primary copies. Vocera grants you the right to use the applicable License Key issued by Vocera only to enable Use of the Server Software in conjunction with the licensed Server Computers.
(b) Hosted Service. If a Hosted Service for Vocera Care Transition Software is provided, then subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA, Vocera grants you the non-exclusive right to utilize the Hosted Service during the applicable Subscription Term solely for your internal use in conjunction with the Vocera Software, and other Products or Services you have licensed or purchased.

All right, title, and interest in the Software and Product Documentation, including without limitation all patent rights, copyrights and other intellectual property rights thereto, is retained by Vocera and its Licensors. You (including your permanent and temporary employees and subcontractors) may run the Software and use the corresponding Product Documentation subject to the restrictions herein solely for your internal business purposes.

Microsoft may, in conjunction with such license, also download revocation lists onto your Device on behalf of Secure Content Owners, which may disable your Devices ability to copy, store, display, transfer, and/or play Secure Content.  Secure Content Owners may also require you to upgrade some of the WM-DRM components distributed with this Software (WM-DRM Upgrades) before accessing their content.  When you attempt to play Secure Content, WM-DRM Software built by Microsoft will notify you that a WM-DRM Upgrade is required and then ask for your consent before the WM-DRM Upgrade is downloaded.  WM-DRM Software built by TP VISION may do the same.  If you decline the upgrade, you will not be able to access Secure Content that requires the WM-DRM Upgrade; however, you will still be able to access unprotected content and Secure Content that does not require the upgrade.  WM-DRM features that access the Internet, such as acquiring new licenses and/or performing a required WM-DRM Upgrade, can be switched off.  When these features are switched off, you will still be able to play Secure Content if you have a valid license for such content already stored on your Device.  However, you will not be able to use certain of the WM-DRM Software features that require Internet access such as the ability to download content that requires the WM-DRM Upgrade.  All title and intellectual property rights in and to the Secure Content is the property of the respective Secure Content owners and may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties.  This Agreement grants you no rights to use such Secure Content.  To summarize, if the Software contains Microsoft WM-DRM components  Secure Content you desire to download, copy, store, display, transfer, and/or play is protected by the Microsoft WM-DRM components of the Software.  Microsoft, Secure Content Owners, or Secure Content distributors may deny you access, or restrict your access, to Secure Content even after you have paid for, and/or obtained, it.  Neither your consent nor the consent or approval of TP VISION is necessary for any of them to deny, withhold or otherwise restrict your access to Secure Content.  TP VISION does not guaranty that you will be able to download, copy, store, display, transfer, and/or play Secure Content.  

5. Open Source Software.  (a) This software may contain components that are subject to open-source terms, as stated in the documentation accompanying the Device. This Agreement does not apply to this software as such. (b) Your license rights under this Agreement do not include any right or license to use, distribute or create derivative works of the Software in any manner that would subject the Software to Open Source Terms.  "Open Source Terms" means the terms of any license that directly or indirectly (1) create, or purport to create, obligations for TP VISION with respect to the Software and/or derivative works thereof; or (2) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights or immunities under intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Software or derivative works thereof.  

6. Termination.

TP VISION provides the Software as is and without any warranty except that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation accompanying the Software for a period of one year after your first download, installation or use of the Software, whichever occurs first.  TP VISIONs entire liability and your exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty shall be, at TP VISION option, either (i) return of the price paid by you for the Software (if any); or (b) repair or replacement of the Software that does not meet the warranty set forth herein and that is returned to TP VISION with a copy of your receipt.  This limited warranty shall be void if failure of the Software has resulted from any accident, abuse, misuse or wrongful application.  Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. This limited warranty shall not apply to you if the Software was provided to you free of charge on an evaluation only basis.

exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties with respect to the license granted herein and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to such license and any waivers or amendments shall be effective only if executed in writing by FireEye; however, any pre-

It is expressly stated that ForNAV is not responsible for downtime or other interruptions in the service relating to Microsoft Azure (or other cloud computing platforms) and/or otherwise out of ForNAV's control.
5.2. The usage of ForNAV online services on Microsoft Azure (or other cloud computing platforms) is covered by ForNAV, based on "fair usage" consumption. This is defined as executing 100 pages (print to printer, PDF, Microsoft Word, preview, Save As...) per user per day, measured as an average over 30 days. For the "unlimited users" license, this is defined as 1000 pages (print to printer, PDF, Microsoft Word, preview, Save As...) per day, measured as an average over 30 days. Should the number of pages exceed this, ForNAV reserves the right to invoice the Licensee for additional cloud computing usage.
5.3. When using the ForNAV online services, data are transferred to and from the service. This data is not stored or logged by ForNAV. The Licensee accepts that ForNAV can have access to data as part of a support incident, preventive troubleshooting, debugging, or other activities to ensure stable operation of the ForNAV online services. ForNAV may collect telemetry data about usage of the software for performance, optimization, improvement, and statistics.
6. UPDATES
6.1. ForNAV will use its best endeavors to ensure on-going development of the Software, including correction of errors and inexpediency and, at the discretion of ForNAV, to change the Software with the aim of making the Software compatible with new versions of thirdparty's standard software.
6.2. Subscription license: 6.2.1. When purchasing a subscription license to the Software, an update fee is included in the subscription license, thus the Licensee will have access to relevant updates.
6.3. Perpetual license: 6.3.1. When purchasing a perpetual license to the Software, the purchase of relevant updates is mandatory in the first year (the "Initial Update Term"). The Initial Update Term runs from the date of purchase for the following 12 months. The Licensee must pay an update fee for the Initial Update Term, according to the ForNAV Pricelist.
6.3.2. After the expiry of the Initial Update Term, the Licensee will have access to relevant updates, unless the Licensee has informed the Partner otherwise by giving three (3) months' written notice to the end of an update term (a 12-month period). The Licensee must pay an update fee for access to these updates, according to the ForNAV Pricelist.
6.3.3. Should the Licensee decide not to renew, the Licensee will no longer be eligible for any new updates, to support, nor to purchase any additional users or features to the license.
6.4. In the event that the Licensee has terminated this Agreement with or without cause in accordance with the provision in clause 11 and wants to reactivate it, the Licensee must pay for both the updates that have been released in the inactive term and any new updates.

8. ASSIGNMENT
8.1. The Licensee is not entitled to lend, lease, sublicense, transfer, or otherwise assign its rights and obligations given under this Agreement without ForNAV's prior written consent.

Features") may be unavailable to you or available subject to certain limitations, 
as follows:

feature you explicitly request ZoneAlarm to make a determination for you on the 
potential effect identified programs may have on your system.  You agree that 
we may automatically delete certain programs and/or provide you the customized 
ability to delete certain programs.  The deletion of these programs may be in 
violation with other license agreements you have knowingly or unknowingly agreed 
to. The deletion of these programs and the potential violation of a third party 
license is your responsibility.  ZoneAlarm has no ability to verify what, if any, 
third party agreements you may have agreed to.    

3. SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES:  If you select to download a fully licensed version of the 
Software (or upgrade to a fully licensed version of the Software if you have previously

you for the designated time the subscription service was purchased.

3.1 TECHNICAL SUPPORT:  Subject to payment of the applicable license fee, ZoneAlarm will 
provide you with technical support, free of charge, for a limited period commencing on 
your payment of such license fee.  You may obtain continued technical support for a 
specified period of time by paying ZoneAlarm's applicable then-current fee for Subscription 
Services and installing the applicable license keys, provided that such option is made 
available to you.  All technical support is provided subject to ZoneAlarm's then-current 
technical support policy, and includes such updates to the Software as ZoneAlarm may make 
generally available thereunder from time to time in ZoneAlarm's sole discretion.  In the event

services available to you.  Such additional services will be provided subject to ZoneAlarm's

to discontinue any such additional services and/or offer new additional services at any time, 
without right to refund or set-off.

specific operating system versions.  For updated support notifications on your operating system,

4. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS:  You acknowledge that the foregoing license extends only to your use 
of the features and functionality of the Software as described in the online documentation

Software which will enable you to (i) use the Software (including Special Features) during the 
term of your license and (ii) obtain certain subscription-based services ("Subscription Services") 
for a limited period pursuant to the terms of Section 3 ("Subscription Services").  In the event 
you subsequently purchase continued Subscription Services pursuant to Section 3 ("Subscription

for installation with the Software to enable you to obtain such Subscription Services for the 
applicable subscription period.  You agree not to purchase any license keys or similar computer 
code for the Software from any source other than ZoneAlarm or ZoneAlarm's authorized partners.  

7. TITLE:  You agree that no title to the intellectual property in the Software, Subscription 
Services (as defined), or license keys is transferred to you.  Title, ownership, rights, and 
intellectual property rights in and to the Software, Subscription Services, and license keys 
shall remain in ZoneAlarm and/or ZoneAlarm's licensors.  The Software, Subscription Services 
and license keys are protected by intellectual property laws of the United States and other 
countries and by international treaties.

8. WARRANTY:
8.1 Limited Warranty. ZoneAlarm warrants to You that the encoding of the Software on the media 
on which the Software is furnished will be free from defects in material and workmanship, and 
that the Software shall substantially conform to its user manual, as it exists at the date of 
delivery, for a period of ninety (90) days from the date You receive the original License Key. 
ZoneAlarms entire liability and Your exclusive remedy shall be, at ZoneAlarm's option, either: 
(i) return of the price paid to ZoneAlarm for the Software, resulting in the termination of 
this Agreement, or (ii) repair or replacement of the Software or media that does not meet this 
limited warranty. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or 
limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply 
to You. This warranty gives You specific legal rights. You may have other rights that vary 
from state to state.

8.2 GENERAL:  The Software and Subscription Services are provided to you at minimal charge.  
ZoneAlarm does not guarantee that use of the Software or Subscription Services will be uninterrupted 
or error-free.  ZoneAlarm does not guarantee that the information accessed by the Software or 
Subscription Services will be accurate or complete.  You acknowledge that performance of the 
Software and Subscription Services may be affected by any number of factors, including without 
limitation, technical failure of the Software, the acts or omissions of third parties and other 
causes reasonably beyond the control of ZoneAlarm.  Certain features of the Software may not be 
forward-compatible with future versions of the Software and use of such features with future 
versions of the Software may require purchase of the applicable future version of the Software.
8.3 AS IS SALE:  EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 8.1, YOU AGREE THAT
ZONEALARM AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE MADE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, ORAL OR WRITTEN, TO YOU REGARDING THE 
SOFTWARE AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AND THAT THE SOFTWARE AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES ARE BEING 
PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD 
THE SOFTWARE AND/OR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU (AND NOT ZONEALARM, THE RETAILER, 
OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIRS.
8.4 DISCLAIMER:  ZONEALARM DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR 
STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION, (i) THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF 
THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (ii) THAT THE SOFTWARE 
OR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES WILL AVERT OR PREVENT ALL OCCURRENCES (OR THE CONSEQUENCES THEREFROM) 
THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO DETECT AND/OR PREVENT; OR (iii) THAT 
ANY INFORMATION ACCESSED BY THE SOFTWARE OR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE.  
THIS WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY 
FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES 
OR LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

9. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT FOR BODILY INJURY OF A PERSON, IN NO EVENT WILL ZONEALARM BE 
LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS 
AGREEMENT, THE PRODUCT OR ANY SERVICES UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER 
THEORY, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), 
OR FOR LOSS OF OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, OR FOR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR TECHNOLOGY, 
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER ZONEALARM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ZONEALARM'S 
MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LICENSE FEES RECEIVED BY ZONEALARM UNDER THIS 
LICENSE FOR THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT(S) WHICH CAUSED THE DAMAGES. Some jurisdictions do not allow 
the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or 
exclusion may not apply to You.

10. TERMINATION:  This Agreement shall terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms 
of this Agreement.  No notice shall be required from ZoneAlarm to effect such termination.  You may 
also terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying ZoneAlarm in writing of termination.  Upon 
any termination of this Agreement, you must uninstall and destroy all copies of the Software.

Imagine Learning End-User License Agreement
END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
NOTICE TO END-USER: This legally binding End-User Software License Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between you, the purchaser/licensee and end-user (an individual or entity referred to hereinafter as either "you" or the "End-User"), and Imagine Learning, Inc., a Utah corporation (referred to hereinafter as the "Company"), the owner/licensor of the subject Software (hereinafter defined) that you are licensing from the Company (whether directly or indirectly through its authorized distributors). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR ACT OF USING THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE FURNISHED TO YOU BY THE COMPANY OR ITS DISTRIBUTOR CONCLUSIVELY CONFIRMS YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT (AND THE SOFTWARE) AND YOUR PROMISE TO HONOR ALL OBLIGATIONS OF THE END-USER HEREUNDER. THEREFORE, YOU NEED TO FIRST REVIEW THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND IF YOU AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN, AND ONLY THEN, MAY YOU USE THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ENTIRE SOFTWARE PACKAGE (INCLUDING ALL DOCUMENTATION) AND RETURN ANY PROVIDED HARDWARE TO THE COMPANY OR ITS DISTRIBUTOR (UNUSED AND UNDAMAGED) NO LATER THAN TEN (10) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF YOUR PURCHASE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A REFUND OF THE UNUSED PORTION OF YOUR SOFTWARE PURCHASE PRICE. SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE INSTALLATION AND TRAINING COSTS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.
1. Grant of License. In connection with your purchase of the Software license, you are hereby granted a limited, nonexclusive license (the "License") to use the Software for its intended educational purposes, furnished to you by the Company or its distributor, as authorized by the Company, as part of the subject License (but specifically excluding any use of the Software to render similar services to others, or for any resale, sublicense or any other third-party transaction). The term "Software", for purposes of this Agreement, means the Imagine Learning software package (including any and all individual products under the Imagine Learning umbrella and future improvements or enhancements thereto) licensed by you from the Company or our distributor, along with the related documentation and any updates and bug fixes the Company may send you in the future. The End-User may contract hereafter for support and maintenance pursuant to the distributor's standard support agreement.
2. Term and Termination. The term of this License, upon payment in full of all fees and charges itemized on the purchase order, is subscription based (or perpetual if specifically determined by your type of purchase) if you honor all terms and conditions hereof. However, the Company may terminate the License at any time if the End-User breaches any term or condition hereof and fails to cure the same to the Company's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days after End-User's receipt of written notice of such breach from the Company. The End-User agrees that the Company will invoice the End-User for any licenses activated above the number of licenses issued through the original purchase order. Payment in full is due within sixty (60) days of invoice and if not received by the Company, the Software and any provided hardware are subject to removal and/or de-authorization by the Company. Upon termination of the License, the End-User shall return to the Company or its distributor any provided hardware, along with the original and all copies of the Software, in written and electronic formats, and shall certify in writing that all originals and all copies and parts thereof have been returned (or otherwise destroyed to the Company's satisfaction). Thereafter, the End-User shall continue to honor all provisions set forth herein for the protection of the Company's Software, intellectual property, confidential information and reputation.
3. Limitations; Transfers. You agree not to modify, adapt or translate the Software, and you further agree not to, nor attempt to, replicate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise discover or misappropriate the source code of the Software, nor copy nor distribute the same. You may not disclose to any third party all or any part of the Software or any confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets relating thereto (i.e., information not in the public domain) without the Company's prior written consent; provided, however, that you may make such disclosures to your own employees who have a "need to know" for your licensed use of the Software, but all such employees must be informed of their duty to honor all provisions of this License (in particular, paragraphs 1, 2, 3,

Copyright © Imagine Learning, Inc.

Imagine Learning End-User License Agreement
4 and 8 hereof). You may not resell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, or loan all or any part of the Software to any third party. The Software is licensed as a single unit, and its component programs may not be separated for any other use. The Company may enter your premises upon reasonable notice during regular business hours and conduct periodic audits to verify that you are honoring all terms and conditions of this limited License.
4. Ownership. Title, all ownership rights, and all intellectual property rights in and to the Software, all materials and intellectual property related thereto, and any provided hardware shall remain exclusively with the Company. The Software is protected by United States patent law and copyright law, international patent and copyright treaties, and local trade secret laws, as well as other intellectual property laws, regulations and treaties. No title to or ownership of the Software has been transferred to you, and this License shall not be construed as a sale of any rights in the Software, but merely a limited, non-exclusive license. You agree not to remove or alter any patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices on any copy of the Software. The Company and its authorized distributors reserve all rights not expressly granted to you herein.
5. Indemnification; Injunction. The End-User shall fully indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, legal fees and costs suffered or incurred by the Company as a result of any material breach by the End-User and its employees or agents of any provision of this Agreement; and the EndUser further agrees that any such actual or threatened breach will cause the Company to incur incalculable and irreparable damage for which there is no adequate remedy at law, entitling the Company to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in addition to all other available remedies.
6. Limited Warranty and Remedy. The Software is provided by the Company and accepted by the End-User "as is." The Company warrants only that the Software and any provided hardware will perform substantially in accordance with the Company's accompanying explanatory materials for the duration of the End-User's subscription period. The Company's sole and exclusive liability, and your exclusive remedy, for any breach of this sole warranty or this Agreement, shall be limited to (at the Company's option) either the (i) replacement or (ii) repair of the Software (or the provided hardware, as the case may be). Any replacement Software or hardware will be warranted similarly. The Company is not liable for any performance delays or for nonperformance due to causes beyond its reasonable control or caused by you or any third party(ies). The Company does not warrant the Software, any provided hardware, or headsets against damage, loss, or theft. This Limited Warranty is in addition to any and all other warranties that may be passed through to the End-User by the Company from third party software vendors (e.g., Microsoft). This limited warranty is void if any failure of the Software results from any accident, abuse, misapplication, or modification of the Software by you or any third party. Headsets resold to the End-User as a service to the End-User become the property and responsibility of the End-User and may include a limited warranty from the manufacturer but will not include a separate warranty from the Company. THE ABOVE-STATED LIMITED WARRANTY AND REMEDIES ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, AND THE COMPANY AND ITS DISTRIBUTORS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES. IN SUCH STATES SOME OR ALL OF THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
7. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY OR ITS DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND WHETHER ARISING UNDER CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, MISREPRESENTATION, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE COMPANY OR ITS DISTRIBUTORS OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVE(S) HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

Copyright © Imagine Learning, Inc.

Page 2 of 5

Imagine Learning End-User License Agreement
SUCH DAMAGES; AND IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY'S OR ITS DISTRIBUTORS' LIABILITY OR EXPOSURE TO THE END-USER OR END-USER'S ASSIGNEE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EVER EXCEED THE END-USER'S PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY. THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONTAMINATION OR LOSS OF DATA OR ANY ADVERSE IMPACT, FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL OR OTHERWISE, DUE TO YOUR OR ANY THIRD PARTY'S MISUSE OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY ACT NOT LICENSED OR APPROVED BY THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
8. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. The Software is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS, and any use, duplication or disclosure of the Software by the United States Government is subject to those restrictions set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of "Rights in Technical Data and Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights," at 48 CFR 52.227-19, and any amendments thereto, as applicable. You agree that neither all nor any part of the Software will be shipped, transferred or exported in any form into any country outside the U.S.A. or used in any manner prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, restrictions or regulations.
9. FERPA Compliance. In providing the Software for use by any educational agency or institution, the Company is acting as a contractor as described under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 34 CFR 99.31 (a)(1)(i)(B). As required for FERPA compliance, the Company is under the direct control of the agency or institution with respect to the use and maintenance of education records pertaining to that agency or institution. Such control includes the ability of the educational agency or institution to dictate the level of data collection performed by the Software. The Company does not redisclose data to any other parties per limitations imposed by 34 CFR 99.33.
10. General Provisions. This Agreement is the final expression of the Company's and the End-User's agreement and is intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions thereof, including any exhibits attached hereto. Any waiver of any performance required hereunder of either party shall be valid only in the instance for which it is given, not for any future instances or other provisions hereof, and only if waived in writing by the party otherwise benefiting from such performance. Access to usage, performance, and efficacy data of all types from all Company software shall be granted at all times to the Company and may be used for reports, evaluations, and publications without restriction as long as the public reports, evaluations, and publications contain no individual student identification information. The End-User will not engage in, allow, assist, or permit any report, evaluation or publication of usage, performance, or efficacy data related to or derived from the Company's software without prior express written permission. Other than the Company's income taxes, the End-User shall be solely responsible for all taxes, assessments, fees, duties, etc. that may be charged by any governmental authority by virtue of this Agreement and/or your use of the Software. The Company's licensors who have contributed software or code to the Software (e.g., Microsoft) are direct and intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and may enforce it directly against you, but without any liability to you for damages of any kind that may arise out of this Agreement. Any action for breach of this Agreement must be commenced by the non-breaching party within one (1) year from the later of: (i) the date the cause of action arises, or (ii) the date the cause of action is discovered (or in the exercise of reasonable diligence by you, should have been discovered). This Agreement and all matters relating hereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah and the United States of America. This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. Both parties agree to resolve any controversy or dispute relating to this Agreement (other than equitable relief permitted under paragraph 6) by binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules and procedures of the International Chamber of Commerce in Salt Lake City, Utah. In any suit, arbitration or appeal regarding this Agreement, the prevailing party's attorneys' fees and costs shall be reimbursed in full by the non-prevailing party. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found by arbitration or a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to any applicable law, such law shall be deemed controlling and this Agreement shall be regarded as modified accordingly, giving maximum permissible effect to the parties' intentions

expressed herein, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The individuals executing this Agreement are fully authorized to do so by their respective companies' bylaws and/or board resolutions. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their successorsin-interest and permitted assigns.

FONT END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
By installing and using the Product, you agree to the following terms and conditions.
1. Grant of License. The Product contains font software programs which generate human readable typeface designs ("Font Software"). You may not install or use the Font Software on any device except one on which you have installed a properly licensed copy of the Product. The Font Software is supplied to you for Internal Use only. "Internal Use," as used herein, means use (i) in the course of your customary and ordinary internal business, or (ii) for your personal use. If used in the course of your customary and ordinary internal business, Internal Use shall mean use solely by your authorized agents and employees. If used for personal use, Internal Use shall mean use solely by individuals who reside with you in your household. All such agents, employees and household residents must agree to the terms and conditions of this End-User License Agreement as a condition of using the Font Software. Internal Use shall occur when an individual is able to give commands (whether by keyboard or otherwise) that are followed by the Font Software, regardless of the location in which the Font Software resides.
2. Limitations. You may not convert the Font Software into a different format. You may not alter or modify the Font Software in any manner which results in the Font Software having different or enhanced functionality then when it was delivered to you as part of the Product.
You may use an application program such as Adobe Acrobat to embed the Font Software into an electronic document. You may send such an electronic document to a third party only for the purpose of permitting the third party to view and print the electronic document. Font Software may not be embedded in any format which permits the recipient of an electronic document to install the Font Software or to use the Font Software for any purpose beyond merely viewing and printing the document. You may not embed Font Software into a Commercial Product. A "Commercial Product" is an electronic document which is distributed in exchange for a fee or other consideration. For example, you cannot embed Font Software into an electronic book or magazine which is offered to the public for a fee.
Except for the print and view embedding permission granted in paragraph 4 above, you may not copy the Font Software; provided, however, you may make one copy of the Font Software for archival purposes only. The archival copy cannot be distributed and can be used only when you have permanently deleted the original or any copy of the Font Software on your device. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or take any action which results in or is designed to result in gaining access to the source code of the Font Software, except as permitted by law and then only for the purpose of achieving an interoperable program.
3. Ownership. The Font Software supplied with the Product is proprietary and is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trademark law. All rights not expressly set forth herein are reserved. A breach of this End-User License Agreement may subject you to damages and injunctive relief under this Agreement as well as under applicable copyright and trademark law.
4. Limited Warranty. YOU AGREE THAT THE FONT SOFTWARE IS SUPPLIED TO YOU WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR MERCHANTABILITY. You agree that the Font Software is supplied without any warranty that the Font Software is free of all bugs, errors, and omissions. YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL THE PROVIDER OF THE PRODUCT OR ITS SUPPLIERS,

Copyright © Imagine Learning, Inc.

Page 4 of 5

Imagine Learning End-User License Agreement
INCLUDING THE SUPPLIER(S) OF THE FONT SOFTWARE, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU NOTIFIED THE PROVIDER OF THE PRODUCT AND THE SUPPLIERS OF THE FONT SOFTWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. You agree that your sole and exclusive remedy and the sole liability of the provider of the Product and the supplier(s) of the Font Software for defective Font Software is, upon return of the defective Font Software to the provider of the Product, either and at the sole option of the provider of the Product (i) the replacement of defective Font Software or (ii) the refund of your licensee fee paid for such Font Software. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitations of incidental, consequential or special damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. Also, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you. To the greatest extent permitted by law, any implied warranties not effectively excluded by this Agreement are limited to ninety (90) days. Some jurisdictions do not permit a limitation or exclusion of implied warranties where the product results in physical injury or death, so such limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. In those jurisdictions, you agree that the liability of the supplier of the Font Software for such physical injury shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars (U.S. $100,000), provided that such jurisdictions permit a limitation of such liability. This warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Other than as expressly set forth herein, the Font Software is non-returnable and nonrefundable.
5. Term and Termination. This license shall remain in effect so long as you are in material compliance with all of its terms and conditions. If you breach any of the terms and conditions, this license is automatically terminated and you are obligated to destroy the original and all copies of the Font Software. In such event, upon the request of the provider of the Product or the suppliers of the Font Software, you shall provide written certification of such destruction.
6. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If you are acquiring the Font Software on behalf of any unit or agency of the United States Government, the following provisions shall apply. Use, duplication or disclosure by the United States Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause at FAR 252.227-7013, subdivision (b)(3)(ii) or subparagraph (c)(1)(ii), as appropriate. Further use, duplication or disclosure is subject to restrictions to restricted rights software as set forth in FAR 52.227-19(c)(2).

1.  	License Grant.  Subject to payment of the applicable license fee and the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Documentation and the applicable Quotation, Licensor grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software and the Documentation for your own internal business purposes. Such use is limited to the number of licenses and duration for which you paid the applicable license fee.

The Copy may not be used to implement fault tolerant, redundant, or contingency environments. Proprietary rights notices on Software and Documentation must be reproduced and applied to any Copy.
2.  	License Restrictions.  
(a) NetScout and its third-party licensors (such third-party licensors, the "Suppliers") retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software and all copies.  No title to the Software, or to any intellectual property or other rights, is transferred to you other than as specified in this Agreement. No right, title or interest in or to any trademarks, service marks, or trade names of Licensor or its Suppliers is granted by this Agreement. Software is copyrighted and contains proprietary information and trade secrets belonging to Licensor and its Suppliers.  
Except as required by law, you will not, and will not cause or permit others to, derive the source code of the Software, or reverse engineer, disassemble, or de-compile the Software. In addition, you may not and will not cause or permit others to (i) create derivative works of the Software, (ii) lend, rent, lease, assign, sublicense, and/or make available through timesharing the Software, (iii) disclose the results of any benchmark tests run on the Product without Licensor consent, or (iv) without Licensor's prior written authorization, transfer the Software or provide third party access to the Software.  Transfers will only be permitted for products with no more than minimal differences in price, features, and functionality and provided that the transfer does not increase the number of licensed copies. Any violation of these restrictions will be cause for immediate termination by Licensor of this Agreement and any licenses granted.
(b) If you move the Product from one location to another ("Product Relocation"), you do so at your own risk, loss and expense. You are responsible for obtaining all necessary licenses to export, re-export or import the Product. You will indemnify, defend and hold Licensor harmless from and against all claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, losses, and expenses including without limitation attorneys' fees and disbursements and court costs (collectively, "Claims") arising from Product Relocation.

If the Product contains Third-Party Materials, or if you have the option to use the Product in conjunction with Third-Party Materials (as identified by the Documentation), then such Third-Party Materials are provided or accessible subject to the applicable third-party terms contained either in an electronic file located in the Software, or in a document, application CD or appendix to the Product Documentation.  You agree to abide by the terms of said licenses and to obtain any additional licenses that may be required to use the Third-Party Materials, including but not limited to patent licenses. Your use of Third- Party Materials in conjunction with the Product and in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement is permitted, provided, however, that you may have broader rights under the applicable Third-Party Materials license and nothing in this Agreement is intended to impose further restrictions on your use of such Third-Party Materials. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor harmless from and against all Claims arising from failure to obtain, or breach of, Third-Party Materials licenses. To the extent Products include Third-Party Materials licensed to Licensor by third parties, those third parties are third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, the applicable provisions of this Agreement as well as the Third-Party Materials terms and conditions.
(e) If you are using the Product to perform network management and monitoring services for third parties ("Managed Services"), the following terms apply, unless you have a signed agreement with NetScout, in which case the terms of the signed agreement will govern your use of the Product in support of your Managed Services activity.  Title to the Hardware and licenses to Software remain with you and may not be resold or sublicensed to your Managed Services customer. You are hereby granted the right to use the Software for monitoring and managing the networks of your Managed Services customers.  In addition to needing a Software license for use of the Software in support of your internal business operations, you will need to purchase a separate Software license for deployment and use of the Software by each of your Managed Services customers. You will maintain Maintenance for Products associated with your Managed Services on behalf of your customers.  You will not replace or make repairs or modifications (collectively, "Repairs") to the Hardware or any of its components.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2(b), transfers of Products from an identified location to a different location will require Licensor's prior written consent, and you will notify Licensor of the name and new address of your Managed Services customer associated with such transfer.  You will indemnify, defend, and hold Licensor harmless from and against all Claims, incurred by Licensor arising from (i) Repairs made by you or any third party, (ii) misrepresentations made by you to your Managed Services customer related to the Products or Maintenance, (iii) your performance of Managed Services, (iv) use of Products in violation of applicable country export restrictions, or (v) your infringement of Licensor or its Suppliers' intellectual property rights.  You may permit your Managed Services customer access to Products located on premises owned or under the control of such customer, provided that (vi) the customer accesses such Products for its own internal business purposes, (vii) the customer executes a written confidentiality agreement with you that incorporates terms at least as protective of the Products and Services as provided in this Agreement, and (viii) you remain responsible for breach of such confidentiality agreement or any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement by your Managed Services customers. 
(f)  If you use the services of a third party to perform network management and monitoring services on your behalf (such third party an "Outsourcer" and such services, "Outsourcing Services"), then the following terms apply.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, (i) Outsourcer may access the Products and Maintenance solely for purposes of performing Outsourcing Services, (ii) Outsourcer must use the Products and Maintenance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (iii) you remain liable for and will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NetScout from and against any and all Claims associated with (1) all actions, demands, and suits brought against Licensor arising from Outsourcer's use of the Products and Maintenance in a manner not permitted hereunder or in the Documentation, or repairs to the Hardware or replacements or modifications to components thereto, or (2) breach of the license grant, license restrictions, Licensor's intellectual property rights, or confidentiality obligations hereunder by you or Outsourcer, (iv) Outsourcer executes a written confidentiality agreement with you that incorporates terms at least as protective of Licensor's Confidential Information, as provided herein, (v) you provide written notification to NetScout of the proposed transaction and identification of the proposed Outsourcer and the affected Products and Maintenance, and (vi) if the Products are relocated to a data processing facility of Outsourcer, the installation and operation of the Products will be strictly limited to computer processors exclusively dedicated for your  sole access, use and benefit.  Any violation of the foregoing will be cause for immediate termination by NetScout of this Agreement and any licenses granted as a result.  In any event, you will remain responsible for all payment and other obligations which will remain in full force.   
3.  	License Term.  The license is effective until terminated.

End User License Agreement for NGINX Plus - Google Cloud Platform

NGINX License Agreement Nginx Software, Inc. v2014-04-14

NGINX LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Nginx License Agreement ('Agreement') is a legal agreement between you (the 'End User') and
Nginx Software, Inc. ('NGINX') for the NGINX software (the 'Software') licensed to End User hereunder
and supplied to End User. The term Software includes any APIs, software modules, and any associated
materials and 'online' or electronic documentation.  This Agreement applies to End User's use of the
Software but it shall be superseded by any signed agreement between End User and NGINX concerning
the Software.

1. Software license

Notwithstanding any reference to 'sale' or 'purchase', the Software is licensed, not sold.  Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, NGINX grants End User a nonIexclusive, nonItransferable right
to access and use the Software as part of the web hosting services for End User's internal use
('Authorized Use') in object form in the products, versions, and number of installed instances as
purchased from NGINX.

2. Limitations

2.1. Restrictions.  End User shall not itself, or through any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, agent or other
third party: (a) sell, lease, license, distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer in whole or in part, the 
Software to a third party; (b) decompile, disassemble, translate, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt
to derive source code from the Software except to the limited extent, if any, that applicable law permits
such acts notwithstanding any contractual prohibitions, provided, however, before End User exercises
any rights that End User believes to be entitled to based on mandatory law, End User shall provide
NGINX with thirty (30) days prior written notice and provide all reasonably requested information to
allow NGINX to assess End User's claim and, at NGINX's sole discretion, to provide alternatives that
reduce any adverse impact on NGINX's intellectual property or other rights; (c) allow access or permit
use of the Software by any third party except authorized thirdIparty contractors solely to provide
services to End User, provided that End User shall be liable for all acts and omissions of such authorized
thirdIparty contractors; (d) modify or create derivative works based upon the Software; (e) disclose the
results of any benchmark test of the Software to any third party; (f) change any proprietary rights
notices which appear in the Software; or (g) circumvent the license keys embedded within the Software.

2.2. Software Transfer.  Upon written consent from NGINX, which will not be unreasonably withheld,
End User may permanently transfer all of its rights under this Agreement; provided that the recipient
agrees to the terms of this Agreement.

2.3. High Risk Activities.  The Software is not intended for use in hazardous environments requiring failI

safe performance (such as, without limitation, the planning, construction, maintenance, control, or
direct operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control,
medical device and life support machines, or weapon systems) in which the failure of the Software could
lead to death, personal injury or physical and environmental damage ('High Risk Activities'). 
Accordingly, this Agreement excludes any High Risk Activities and End User agrees not to use the
Software in connection with High Risk Activities.

3. Ownership

The Software is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other
intellectual property laws and treaties.  NGINX owns all right, title and interest in the copyrights, patents
and all other intellectual property rights in and to the Software and any accompanying printed materials,
and all derivative works thereof.

4. Open source programs

The Software may include individual open source software components, each of which has its own
copyright and its own applicable license conditions. The open source software components are licensed
to End User under the terms of the applicable open source license conditions and/or copyright notices
that can be found in the licenses file, the related documentation or other materials accompanying the
Software. 

5. Trademarks

The mark 'NGINX' is trademark of NGINX.  NGINX's failure to list a trademark in this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of any trademark rights. All other trademarks in the Software not owned by NGINX
are the property of their respective owners.

6. Disclaimer and Warranty

6.1. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND AND NGINX EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED OR ARISING OUT OF A
COURSE OF CONDUCT OR COURSE OF DEALING, INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES OF TITLE, PERFORMANCE,
USE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONIINFRINGEMENT AND THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.  NGINX MAKES NO
WARRANTY REGARDING NONIINTERRUPTION OF USE.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT PROVIDED
BY NGINX SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY.

6.2. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
SOFTWARE IS ASSUMED BY END USER.  NGINX SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO END USER OR ANY
OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUE, PROFIT OR OPPORTUNITY, LOST OR DAMAGED
DATA OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS, EVEN IF NGINX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR THEY ARE FORESEEABLE.  NGINX'S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE
LIABILITY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY
END USER FOR THE SOFTWARE.

6.3. ALLOCATION.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
BETWEEN NGINX AND END USER.  NGINX'S LICENSING FEES FOR THE SOFTWARE REFLECT THIS
ALLOCATION OF RISKS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND
DISCLAIMERS APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY
FAILS IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

6.4. Limitation.  Because some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers, exclusions or limitations of
warranties, damages or liability, the above disclaimers, exclusions or limitations may not apply to End
User and, therefore, shall apply only to the maximum extent allowed under applicable law.

7. Term

This Agreement is effective until terminated.  End User may terminate the Agreement at any time by
returning or destroying all copies of the Software and related documentation.  End User's rights under
this Agreement will terminate automatically if End User fails to comply with the Agreement. Sections 2I8
shall survive such termination.

8. Miscellaneous

8.1. Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without
reference to the principles of conflicts of law. The provisions of the Uniform Computerized Information
Transaction Act and United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall
not apply to this Agreement.  Any litigation related to this Agreement shall be brought in the state or
federal courts located in New York, New York, and only in those courts and each party irrevocably
waives any objections to such venue.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, NGINX shall be
entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, wherever NGINX deems appropriate in any
jurisdiction, in order to preserve or enforce NGINX's rights for any breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement.

8.2. Severability.  Every term, condition or provision of this Agreement is severable from the others.  If a
court or an arbitrator of competent jurisdiction holds any term, condition or provision of this Agreement
to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal in whole or in part for any reason, the validity and enforceability of
the remaining terms, conditions or provisions, or portions of them, will not be affected. 

8.3. Confidentiality.  Except as expressly allowed by this Agreement, End User will not use or disclose any
Software or related technology, idea, algorithm or information ('Confidential Information') except to the
extent End User can document that it is generally available for use and disclosure by the public without
charge or license.  End User shall hold the Confidential Information in trust and confidence and avoid the
disclosure or release thereof to any other person or entity by using the same degree of care as it uses to
avoid unauthorized use, disclosure, or dissemination of its own Confidential Information of a similar
nature, but not less than reasonable care.  End User may disclose Confidential Information as required
to comply with binding orders of governmental entities that have jurisdiction over it; provided that End
User gives NGINX reasonable written notice to allow NGINX to seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy, discloses only such Confidential Information as is required by the governmental
entity, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential
Information disclosed.  End User recognizes and agrees that there is no adequate remedy at law for a
breach of this Section, that such a breach would irreparably harm NGINX and that NGINX is entitled to
equitable relief (without need to post a bond) with respect to any such breach or potential breach in
addition to any other remedies.

8.4. Indemnity.  End User shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless NGINX, and its officers, directors,
employees and agents (the 'NGINX Indemnitees'), from and against all suits, claims, demands, losses,
liabilities, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) that the NGINX
Indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with: (i) any third party claim arising from End User's
breach of this Agreement; and (ii) any infringement by End User of NGINX's intellectual property rights
in the Software.

8.5. Entire Agreement and Waiver.  The Agreement is the sole, final and entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, may only be amended in writing signed by both NGINX License 
parties.  A failure or delay in enforcing any provisions, exercising any option or requiring performance,
be construed to be a waiver by NGINX.

8.6. Marketing.  NGINX may use End User's name and company logo on its customer list and web site,
and link to End User's web site.

8.7. Independent Contractor.  The relationship of the parties is that of independent contractors.  Neither
party will be deemed to be the legal representative of the other nor will it have any right to bind the
other party to any contract or commitment.  This Agreement does not, and will not, be construed to
create an employerIemployee, agency, joint venture or partnership relationship between the parties. 
Each party agrees to assume complete responsibility for its own employees regarding federal or state
laws, including employers' liability and tax withholding, worker's compensation, social security,
unemployment insurance, and OSHA requirements. 

8.8. Notices.  All notices must be in writing and will be effective three (3) days after the date sent to
each party's corporate headquarters.

8.9. Audit.  During the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year following termination or expiration
(but no more than once in a calendar year), NGINX and its auditors may inspect End User's records
relating to its reproduction and use of the Software for the purposes of verifying End User's compliance
with this Agreement.  End User shall cooperate fully with NGINX and its auditors in conducting audits
and provide reasonable assistance. If an underpayment is discovered, End User shall promptly pay such
amount and End User shall reimburse NGINX for the cost of the audit.

8.10. Government Regulation. End User acknowledges that the Software is subject to export restrictions
by the U.S. government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. End User may not
export or reIexport the Software except in compliance with the U.S. Export Administration Act and the
related rules and regulations and similar non-U.S. government restrictions, if applicable.  End User shall
not and shall not allow any thirdIparty to remove or export from the United States or allow the export
or reIexport of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof: (i) into (or to a national or
resident of) any embargoed or terroristIsupporting country; (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce
Department's Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated
Nationals; (iii) to any country to which such export or reIexport is restricted or prohibited, or as to which
the U.S. government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval
at the time of export or reIexport without first obtaining such license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in
violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or foreign agency
or authority. End User agrees to the foregoing and warrants that it is not located in, under the control
of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list. The
Software is further restricted from being used for terrorist activity, or for the design or development of
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology without the prior permission of the U.S.
government. The Software and accompanying documentation are deemed to be "commercial computer
software" and "commercial computer software documentation", respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section
227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212(b), as applicable.  Any use, modification, reproduction, release,

PLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT"). BY DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING ARISTA SOFTWARE ("SOFTWARE"), OR BY USING ARISTA EQUIPMENT THAT CONTAINS THE SOFTWARE ("EQUIPMENT"), YOU AND ANY ENTITY YOU REPRESENT ("CUSTOMER") AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT WITH ARISTA NETWORKS, INC. ("ARISTA"). IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.
The following terms govern Customer's use of any Software except to the extent particular Software (a) is the subject of a separate written agreement between Customer and Arista; or (b) includes or references a separate license agreement. If any Software is identified in a Purchase Order, invoice or proof of entitlement issued by Arista (collectively, "Proof of Entitlement"), Customer's license to such Software is subject to any additional terms and conditions contained in the Proof of Entitlement, including, without limitation, the term of the license ("License Term"), applicable license fees ("Fees"), applicable devices or types of devices ("Applicable Devices") and limitations with respect to use on a single hardware device, number of devices under management, number of ports or other quantitative limits ("Quantitative Limits"). The Software provided or made available to Customer may include: (a) Arista's Operating System, EOS, (b) features or functionality (e.g., the E, V and Z features of EOS) that Customer may not use unless Customer purchases a separate license to such features and functionality, (c) Arista firmware for relevant Equipment, (d) on premise CloudVision, and (e) on premise WiFi management software. Information about the license terms applicable to the Software (including, without limitation, EOS, EaaS, CloudVision and CloudVision Lite) is available on the Arista website at https://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/Software-Licensing-Framework.pdf.
Limited License Grant. With respect to the specific program modules, feature set(s) or feature(s) of the Software identified in any Proof of Entitlement, and subject to Customer's compliance with the Limitations and Restrictions section of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Customer's payment of any applicable Fees, Arista grants to Customer a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, nonsublicensable and nontransferable license, during the License Term to: (1) download, install and use such Software consistent with the use and restrictions set forth in the applicable Proof of Entitlement and only for Customer's internal business purposes; (2) reproduce, copy, modify, and create derivative works of any such Software that is provided in source code format, only for Customer's internal business purposes; provided, however, that if any Software is provided in source code format, Customer shall not create any derivative works of the Software that contain Open Source Software nor shall Customer use the Software or a portion thereof to merge with, link to, make function calls to, or share data structures with any Open Source Software, if any such combination or use of the Software would require the Software to be made available royalty free or in source code form; (3) use the Software in conjunction with Third Party Software in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement; (4) review the Software including, without limitation, unpacking archives (such as ZIP, SWI and RPM files provided by Arista), and accessing underlying operating system facilities; and (5) extend the Software provided in source code format and linking Customer-developed software to the Software. As used in this Agreement, "Open Source Software" means any software made available by a third party under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative, or any substantially similar license.
Limitations and Restrictions. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the foregoing license grant excludes any right to, and Customer shall not: (1) distribute, sell, transfer, lease, loan, host, assign or sublicense the Software or Customer's license rights under this Agreement, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, to any third party, directly or indirectly, and any such attempted transfer, assignment or sublicense shall be void; (2) use or allow use of the Software on any hardware other than the Equipment or Applicable Devices; (3) modify, reproduce, decompile, decrypt, disassemble, reverse engineer, create derivative works of, translate or otherwise reduce to human-readable form any Software (other than Software that is provided in source code format); gain access to trade secrets or confidential information in the Software; circumvent any copy-protection, hardware version controls, or license enforcement; or attempt to do any of the foregoing, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law; (4) combine, commingle, or integrate any Software with Open Source Software or incorporate Open Source Software into any Software that may add any additional Open Source Software requirements, obligations, or licensing terms to the Software; (5) disclose to any third party any results of benchmarking or other testing generated in connection with Customer's use of Software, including without limitation any comparisons of the Software or Equipment with any other products; (6) provide a third party with a copy of or access to the Software (including, without
Standard EULA ­ Rev. 2020 03 18

limitation, source code), in any manner, (if Customer does so, Customer will be responsible to Arista for all acts of such third party); (7) remove from the Software (or fail to include in any copy) any readme files, notices, headers, disclaimers, marks or labels; and (8) use or allow use of the Software in violation of any applicable law or regulation or to support or facilitate any illegal activity. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Customer shall not attempt to circumvent any security or access restrictions relevant to Software versions or features therein. Customer shall be liable to Arista for any damages, injury or harm caused to Arista as a result of Customer's violation of any of these limitations or restrictions.
Evaluation License. Arista may make certain Software available in object code form to end users only for evaluation, training or other limited non-commercial purposes without charging a Fee ("Evaluation License"). Where Arista has provided an Evaluation License, all of the terms of this End User License Agreement shall apply except that (i) Customer's license rights shall be limited to the evaluation of that Software, (ii) Customer shall not be required to pay a Fee for the evaluation of that Software and (iii) Arista shall have the right to revoke the license to the Software at any time and for any reason.
Installation. Customer is responsible for installing the Software and Equipment (if applicable), unless Customer purchases installation services from Arista pursuant to a separate agreement.
Updates. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to any upgrades, updates, bug fixes or modified versions (collectively, "Updates") or additional copies of the Software. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement: (1) Customer has no license or right to use any such Updates or additional copies unless Customer, at the time of acquiring them, already holds a valid license to the Software associated with such Updates and has paid any required Fees for such Software; and (2) use of additional copies of the Software is limited to backup purposes only. By downloading or using any Updates, Customer's rights with respect to the Updates are subject to the terms of the latest revision of this Agreement posted at the time of receipt of the Updates, Arista's then-current policies and procedures, and Customer's Proof of Entitlement for the Software associated with such Updates.
Proprietary Notices. Customer agrees to maintain and reproduce all copyright and other proprietary notices on all copies, in any form, of the Software in the same form and manner that such copyright and other proprietary notices are included on the Software. Except as expressly authorized in this Agreement, Customer may make such backup copies of the Software as may be necessary for Customer's lawful use, provided Customer affixes to such copies all copyright, confidentiality, and proprietary notices that appear on the original.
Reservation of Rights. The Software and documentation are owned by Arista and its licensors, and is protected by copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, international conventions, and all other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws. As between Customer and Arista, the Software, including without limitation intellectual property rights therein and thereto, are the sole and exclusive property of Arista or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and/or its third-party licensors. All Software is licensed to Customer, not sold. Arista reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement, and no rights or licenses shall be deemed or interpreted to be granted or transferred hereunder, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. Customer shall not provide the Software, Equipment, documentation, or details regarding the operation of the Software and/or Equipment, or any other confidential and/or proprietary information to any third party.
Fees and Payments. Unless otherwise specified in the Proof of Entitlement, any license or subscription Fees with respect to the Software are due and payable no later than thirty (30) days after the date of invoice or first use of the Software by Customer, whichever is earlier. Late invoices shall be subject to interest of 1.5% per month (or the maximum rate permitted by law if less) plus any expenses of collection. Arista reserves the right to suspend and/or terminate access to the Software if any Fees payable hereunder are past due. Such suspension or termination shall not relieve Customer from its obligation to pay all amounts due under this Agreement.
Taxes. The Fees do not include any foreign, federal, state or local taxes, or any sales, use, excise, ad valorem, value-added, withholding or other taxes or duties that may be applicable to the purchase of Software
Standard EULA ­ Rev. 2020 03 18

(collectively, "Taxes"). Fees pursuant to this Agreement may not be reduced to reflect any Tax or other mandatory payment to government agencies. When Arista has the legal obligation to collect Taxes related to any invoice, unless Customer provides Arista with a valid and acceptable tax exemption certificate prior to issuance of said invoice, the appropriate amount shall be added to Customer's invoice and paid by Customer. If a tax authority subsequently finds that any Tax payment related to any sale or service to Customer was insufficient and requires additional payment by Arista, Arista will make such payment and Customer will reimburse Arista for such additional Tax payments (including, without limitation, any interest, levies, and penalties). Arista will not be responsible for any Taxes or other amount assessed to Customer by any government agency based on Customer's net income, gross revenue, or for any other reason.
Third Party Software. The Software may be distributed alongside certain third party software ("Third Party Software", together with the Software, the "Package") provided under separate license terms (the "Third Party Terms"). Information regarding Third Party Software provided to Customer by Arista is set forth in more detail on the Arista web site at http://www.arista.com/en/gpl and through the Software's help menu. Notwithstanding licenses granted in this Agreement, Customer acknowledges that certain components of the Software may be covered by Open Source Software licenses of third parties ("Open Source Components"). Arista shall provide a list of Open Source Components for a particular version of the Software upon Customer's request. To the extent required by the open source licenses applicable to the Open Source Components, the terms of such licenses will apply to such Open Source Components in lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the terms of the open source licenses applicable to an Open Source Component prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Component, such restrictions will not apply to such Open Source Component. To the extent the terms of the open source licenses applicable to the Open Source Components require Arista to make an offer to provide source code or related information in connection with Open Source Components, such offer is hereby made. Any request for source code or related information should be directed only to: https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/gpl. Customer acknowledges receipt of notices for the Open Source Components for the initial delivery of the Software.
Protection of Information. Customer agrees that the Software and associated documentation, including, without limitation, the specific design and structure of individual programs, constitute trade secrets and/or copyrighted material of Arista. Customer shall not disclose, provide, or otherwise make available such trade secrets or copyrighted material in any form to any third party without the prior written consent of Arista. Customer shall implement reasonable security measures to protect such trade secrets and copyrighted material. Customer must take security measures sufficient to reasonably safeguard the licensed Software from theft or from access by persons other than Customer's or its affiliates's authorized employees or agents.
Commercial Item. The Software and associated documentation are "commercial items" as defined at FAR 2.101 comprised of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as those terms are used in FAR 12.212. Consequently, regardless of whether Customer is United States Government or a department or agency thereof, Customer shall acquire only those rights with respect to the Software and associated documentation that are set forth in this Agreement.
Term and Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated. Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of Software including, without limitation, any documentation. Customer's license rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Arista if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. If Customer's Proof of Entitlement for any Software states that the license for that Software is "Perpetual," then the License Term applicable to that Software is perpetual, subject only to termination for nonpayment of Fees or other breach of this Agreement. If Customer's Proof of Entitlement for any Software states that the license for that Software is a subscription ("Subscription Software"), then the License Term applicable to that Software is for the time period identified in such Proof of Entitlement, subject to early termination for nonpayment of applicable Fees or other breach of this Agreement. In addition, with respect to any Subscription Software, this Agreement, and the license rights afforded hereunder, shall terminate with respect to such Subscription Software upon the earlier of the completion of any License Term for such Subscription Software or immediately upon the failure of Customer to pay any subscription Fees when due and owing to Arista. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, (a) Customer shall immediately cease using any Software and must destroy or return to Arista
Standard EULA ­ Rev. 2020 03 18

all copies of the Software and associated documentation in its possession or control; and (b) Customer shall promptly pay to Arista any amounts owed under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any unpaid Fees.
Limited Software Warranty and Disclaimers. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for any Software identified in a Proof of Entitlement, Arista warrants for a period of 90 days from the Start Date that (i) the media on which the Software is delivered will be free of defects in material and workmanship under normal authorized use consistent with the product instructions and (ii) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with Arista's standard specifications. The sole and exclusive remedy of the Customer and the entire liability of Arista under this limited software warranty shall be (i) for Arista to replace the defective media, and (ii) at Arista's option, to repair, replace or refund the Fees paid for such Software. This limited warranty extends only to the original purchaser. The "Start Date" shall mean the date when the Customer is granted access to the Software on the Arista website or when the Software is shipped from Arista's facilities or from an authorized Arista reseller to Customer, as applicable. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ANY SOFTWARE LICENSED UNDER AN EVALUATION LICENSE, ANY SOFTWARE THAT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT CHARGING ANY FEE, ANY MODIFIED SOFTWARE AND ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE ARE FURNISHED "AS IS," WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. ARISTA DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR ASSURANCE THAT THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY EQUIPMENT OR NETWORK RUNNING THE SOFTWARE, WILL OPERATE WITHOUT ERROR OR INTERRUPTION, OR WILL BE FREE OF VULNERABILITY TO INTRUSION OR ATTACK. CUSTOMER MAY NOT MAKE A WARRANTY CLAIM AFTER EXPIRATION OF THE 90-DAY WARRANTY PERIOD.
No warranty will apply if the Arista product, Equipment or Software (i) has been altered, except by Arista; (ii) has not been installed, operated, repaired, or maintained in accordance with instructions supplied by Arista in the applicable documentation; or (iii) has been subjected to unreasonable physical, thermal or electrical stress, misuse, negligence, or accident. In addition, the Arista products, Equipment and Software are not designed or intended for use in (i) the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility; (ii) navigating or operating aircraft; or (iii) any life-saving, life-support or life-critical medical equipment, and Arista disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses. Customer is solely responsible for assessing the suitability of the Arista products, Equipment and Software for use in particular applications and for backing up its programs and data to protect against loss or corruption. Arista's warranty obligations do not include installation support.
EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THE LIMITED SOFTWARE WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR MEETING CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS, NONINFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, COMPATIBILITY OR INTEROPERABILITY WITH ANY HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS OR DATA NOT PROVIDED BY ARISTA, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR FREEDOM FROM INTERRUPTION OR ERROR, ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED AND EXCLUDED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. TO THE EXTENT AN IMPLIED WARRANTY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE 90-DAY WARRANTY PERIOD OR OTHERWISE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER.
THIS WARRANTY GIVES CUSTOMER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND CUSTOMER MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.
Disclaimer of Liabilities. IN NO EVENT WILL ARISTA OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE OR PROFIT, LOSS OF DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ARISTA OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
Standard EULA ­ Rev. 2020 03 18

EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF ARISTA, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS TO CUSTOMER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID TO ARISTA BY CUSTOMER FOR THE SOFTWARE OR EQUIPMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF SUCH CLAIM IN THE 12-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE WHEN NOTICE OF SUCH CLAIM WAS PROVIDED HEREUNDER. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE-STATED WARRANTY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER. IN SUCH A CASE THE FOREGOING LIMITATION WILL BE APPLIED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW.
Indemnification. Customer shall defend Arista and hold Arista, its affiliates, directors, employees, and representatives harmless against any liabilities, losses, damages, demands, claims, suits, and proceedings as well as fees, expenses and other costs of any kind or nature, including, without limitation, any attorney fees, expert fees, filing fees, judgments, and settlement amounts associated therewith, as and when incurred, arising out of or related to Customer's use of the Software or any breach or alleged breach by Customer or any of Customer's affiliates, employees, representatives, agents or end-users of any obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement and pay any amounts finally awarded or agreed to in settlement of any such claim.
Export and Compliance with Laws. Customer shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with its use of the Software, as well as related technical information and data. Customer acknowledges that the Software may contain encryption or encryption technology and may be subject to certain controls and restrictions under U.S. and non-U.S. export, re-export and other laws, regulations and restrictions (collectively, the "Export Regulations"), including, without limitation, the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended from time to time, and regulations promulgated thereunder, U.S. trade sanction programs, and other regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Department of Commerce or other departments of the U.S. government. Customer agrees that it is solely responsible for obtaining and will obtain any necessary approvals or licenses from the applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer represents and warrants to Arista that it will not, directly or indirectly, export or re-export, supply or otherwise make available the Software or any related technical information or data to any person in violation of any Export Regulation, including, without limitation, re-exporting, supplying or otherwise making available the Software to any person on the U.S. Department of Commerce's Denied Persons List or affiliated lists, on the U.S. Department of Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals List, in a country on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list or on any U.S. export exclusion lists (collectively, the "Export Denial Lists"). Customer represents and warrants that it is not on any of the Export Denial Lists and that Customer is not using and will not use any Software or related technical information or data to further activities in support of development, manufacture or use of nuclear fuel or weapons, missiles, or chemical or biological weapons. Customer further certifies to Arista that Customer will immediately notify Arista if at any time those warranties and representation become no longer accurate.
Trust-Based Licensing Model. Certain Software licensed under this Agreement does not include programmatic license enforcement. It is Customer's responsibility to ensure compliance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, all applicable restrictions set forth herein or in any Proof of Entitlement. By adopting this trust-based licensing model, Arista does not waive its right to enforce any aspect of this Agreement at any time. Additionally, Arista's knowledge of Customer's use of the Software beyond the scope of the license shall not operate as a waiver of Arista's rights to enforce the terms of this Agreement under any legal or equitable doctrine.
Reports and Audit. Customer agrees to monitor its use of the Software and generate accurate, complete and auditable records of its level of use. If at any time Customer becomes aware that it has used any Software without paying any applicable Fees or in excess of the limitations set forth in any applicable Proof of Entitlement, Customer shall promptly notify Arista in writing of such use and pay any additional Fees for the type of the Software or the features or functionality thereof actually used by Customer. Customer agrees that
Standard EULA ­ Rev. 2020 03 18

Arista shall have the right, at Arista's expense, to audit Customer's use of the Software on at least 15 business days' advance notice, during Customer's normal business hours and no more frequently than twice each year, which audit shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer's business. Survival. The license limitations and restrictions contained in the section entitled "Limitations and Restrictions" as well as the following provisions shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement: Reservation of Rights, Protection of Information, Term and Termination, Limited Software Warranty and Disclaimers, Disclaimer of Liabilities, Indemnification, Reports and Audit, and General Provisions. General Provisions. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of laws provisions thereof. Neither the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor those of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall apply.

1 Contracting parties, scope
1.1 This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is made by and between PTV Planung Transport Verkehr AG, Haid-und-Neu-Strasse 15, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany ("PTV") and such entity ("Customer") that has received and/or uses software programs and data provided with the software (together "PTV Software") or data of PTV or of any third party providers ("PTV-Data"), and that entered into an agreement on the delivery and use of such PTV Software and/or PTV-Data with PTV or an affiliate, reseller or other contractual partner (each a "Third-Party Distributor") of PTV, provided that this EULA has become part of the contract. Both PTV and the Customer are being referred to individually as "Party" and jointly as "Parties". The Parties of this EULA shall be PTV and the Customer, even if the Customer received the PTV Software or the PTV-Data from a Third-Party Distributor.
1.2 Where this EULA regulates the rights and obligations of the Parties with regard to PTV-Software, these regulations equally apply to PTV-Data.
1.3 This EULA covers the PTV Software delivered to the Customer in tangible (e.g. on a data carrier) or intangible (e.g. via download) form, whether protected by copyright or not, in any format (source code, object code etc.), as well as all related information, documentation and material such as handbooks, guidelines and technical documentation (collectively the "Licensed Material"). Any translation of the Licensed Material is part of the Licensed Material.
1.4 The rights granted to the Customer under this EULA are limited to:
a) the version of the Licensed Material initially delivered to the Customer;
b) service packs to the Licensed Material delivered to the Customer in the course of the fulfillment of warranty obligations (if any); and
c) updates and updated versions of the Licensed Material provided they were delivered to the Customer under a maintenance agreement and the Customer paid maintenance fees owed pursuant to such maintenance agreement.
1.5 The Customer is responsible for the purchase or licensing of all additional equipment and software necessary to install and operate the Licensed Material as detailed by PTV, if applicable. Updated versions of the Licensed Material may require additional equipment and/or software, as well as updated versions of the equipment and software. Purchase or licensing of these items, if required, is solely the Customer's responsibility.

Intellectual property rights, license

1.6 All third-party providers and suppliers of PTV that are involved in the provision of services are included in the protection provided by these terms. The Customer or partner of PTV shall indemnify these third-party providers and suppliers against claims by third parties resulting from a breach of these terms.

2 Intellectual property rights, license
2.1 PTV and PTV's suppliers hold all right, title, interest and intellectual property rights in and to the Licensed Material (including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets and ancillary rights).
2.2 PTV reserves the right to technically protect the Licensed Material against illegitimate copying, use or distribution with security devices such as dongles, passwords or similar.
2.3 The Customer may only use the Licensed Material itself within its own company for internal business purposes. The Customer has to observe any contractual agreements regarding the use of the PTV Software (e.g. limitation of the number of users, installations etc.) and must secure such limitations by using adequate technical measures (the granting of rights to use the PTV Software to the Customer, hereinafter "License").
2.4 The License granted to the Customer may be granted for a limited period of time ("Time-Limited License") or for an unlimited period of time ("Lifetime License").
2.5 The Customer's Time-Limited License is non-exclusive, limited in time, nontransferable, revocable and non-sublicensable and may only be used during the contract term exclusively for Customer's internal business operations as an end user. The Customer's Lifetime License is non-exclusive, perpetual, non-transferable except as set forth in sec. 5.1, irrevocable, non-sublicensable and may be used exclusively for Customer's internal business operations as an end user. The Parties may agree on further restrictions regarding the duration, territory and scope of the License.

Commencement and withdrawal of rights

2.7 Any use or exploitation of the Licensed Material not explicitly allowed in this EULA or pursuant to mandatory statutory law (e.g. altering, amending, lending, leasing, renting, distribution in tangible or intangible form, outsourcing, software as a service etc.) is subject to the prior written consent of PTV which PTV may give in its sole discretion.
2.8 The Customer may not attempt to alter, translate or modify all or part of the Licensed Material and may not create derivative works from the Licensed Material. The Customer may not transfer, resell or distribute any Licensed Material. The Customer may not in any way, commercially or non-commercially, rent, lease or make available the Licensed Material on a public network unless there is a written agreement with PTV allowing the Customer to do so.
2.9 All use cases of the Licensed Material refer to the use in a closed user circle, i.e. no public and freely accessible applications (public online services) are permitted.
2.10 The Customer may not combine or mix data and results of the PTV Software with third-party applications and third-party data.

3 Commencement and withdrawal of rights
3.1 The granting of rights of use to the Licensed Material is subject to full payment of the license fees. Until full payment of the license fees, PTV grants a right to use in accordance with the provisions of the contract which is revocable at any time and granted for a maximum period of thirty (30) days. Due to an automatic program lock, the PTV Software can no longer be used if full payment of the license fees has not been affected  within thirty (30) days of invoicing; or  at the beginning of the new License Period.
Upon full payment of the license fees, license information will be updated and the PTV Software will be activated by means of the respective licensing technology.
For accounting and control purposes, the PTV Software may be equipped with licensing technology. At regular intervals, the applicable license information is retrieved automatically or with Customer's cooperation from back-end systems of PTV and its contractors and is stored in the software.
The license information retrieved includes, inter alia, data of licensed program versions, software maintenance and update options, functionality and size, licensed number of users, license type and License Period of the PTV Software.

PTV is entitled to irrevocably deactivate licenses reported as being no longer usable (e.g. dongle or computer lost or defective) by Customer, if Customer attempts to use them again.
The licensing technology may require an online access, i.e. that the PTV Software can only be used if online access is available and the license data is successfully matched via Internet. This automatic matching via Internet may be subject to certain restrictions in terms of availability, so that only an availability of 99,9% can be guaranteed for the automated matching of the license information. In the event of non-availability, the Customer shall contact PTV's first-level support for maintenance of the PTV Software.
3.2 Time-Limited Licenses expire automatically at the end of the contractually agreed License Period.
3.3 PTV may withdraw the License for good cause. Such good cause shall be given particularly, but not limited to, if the Customer severely infringes this EULA.
3.4 The Customer's right to use the Licensed Material expires upon expiration or withdrawal of the License. Customer must return to PTV all data carriers, dongles and other devices received from PTV, uninstall the PTV Software including any backup copies thereof, destroy or irreversibly delete the Licensed Material and confirm in writing to PTV that such return, destruction or deletion was completed successfully.

4 Copies, reverse engineering
4.1 The Customer may make a copy of the software part of the Licensed Material for its own security back-up purposes, only as stated in the applicable provisions of mandatory copyright law. Any back-up copy must be stored safely and must be labeled with a correct copyright note. Copyright notes may not be removed, altered or inhibited. Documents may only be copied for the Customer's internal purposes.

Transfer of Licensed Material

4.2 To the extent that mandatory copyright law grants the Customer the right to decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer software in order to receive information necessary for the development of independent compatible computer programs ("Decompilation"), the Customer is obliged to request PTV to provide it with the necessary information before such Decompilation. Decompilation is only allowed if PTV did not provide such information within two (2) weeks of the Customer's request. Any information received by the Customer in this context is subject to strict confidentiality and may not be disclosed to any third party.

5 Transfer of Licensed Material

5.1 For a Lifetime License, the Customer may transfer the Licensed Material legitimately received from PTV or a Third-Party Distributor. Any transfer of a Lifetime License is subject to the following rules:
a) If the Licensed Material was delivered to the Customer on an original data carrier, the Customer may only transfer the Licensed Material on the original data carrier. If the Licensed Material was delivered to the Customer via online download, the Customer may produce and transfer a copy of the files originally downloaded.
b) Upon such transfer, the Customer must irreversibly delete any of its copies of the Licensed Material that has been transferred, whether stored on data media or computers.
c) The Customer may only transfer the whole license and installation of the Licensed Material. It may not transfer parts of such License such as particular usage rights for a contractually agreed number of users, transactions, items etc. If the Licensed Material is installed on a server computer and run on a designated number of client computers (client-server application), the Customer may particularly not transfer usage rights for a number of client computers without disposing of the server installation as such.
d) Dongles may only be sold or imparted along with the associated Licensed Material.
e) Any transfer must be of permanent nature, i.e. without any option or claim of the Customer to get the Licensed Material back after a fixed or variable period of time.
f) The third party to whom the Licensed Material is transferred by the Customer ("Purchaser") commits itself in writing vis-à-vis PTV to observe the terms of this EULA.
g) The Customer must inform PTV in writing in advance on the transfer and provide PTV with the details of the Purchaser.

 System environment data (including O/S version, browser used, application server, database, etc.).

Upon request by PTV, the Customer shall provide additional information for the error analysis.

Error Reports shall be communicated to PTV promptly. Delayed reporting shall relieve PTV from any warranty obligations for the respective Defect.

9.1.3

PTV shall rectify Defects at its choice through subsequent improvements or through delivery of a replacement within a reasonable period of time if and insofar as the selected form of rectification of the Defect is acceptable to the Customer. Such rectification may also include the implementation of a workaround solution.

9.3 The Customer is aware that applications with maps, geographical attributes, points of interest, toll information, emissions, speed limits, truck features, long postcodes and other content as well as traffic data and forecasts never provide a perfectly accurate and complete picture of the actual circumstances, in particular because of the time delay between a change in the actual circumstances and its rendering, and the resulting lack of quality, does not constitute a Defect of the PTV Software.

10.1 Claims and defense against alleged IPR infringement

10.1.1

The Customer shall not be entitled to conclude a settlement with claimants, nor to acknowledge their claims, without PTV's prior written approval.

10.2.1

Insofar as IPR of third parties have been infringed by the Licensed Material for reasons attributable to PTV, PTV may choose to rectify the situation in such a way that the Licensed Material can continue to be used to the full extent by the Customer. In this respect, PTV has the following options:

a) PTV may obtain a license sufficient for the purposes of this EULA from the third party that holds the infringed IPR, in favor of the Customer; or

b) PTV may update, modify or replace the Licensed Material that infringes IPR such that the modifications have no impact on the functionality of the Licensed Material, or an impact that is acceptable to the Customer.

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. 
IF YOU ARE ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, THEN YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU 
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. 
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF 
THIS AGREEMENT OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

This Hortonworks License Agreement ("Agreement") is made by Hortonworks, Inc. ("Hortonworks") 
with its principal place of business at 455 West Maude Ave., Suite 200, 
Sunnyvale, California 94085 and you ("Customer"). The effective date ("Effective Date") 
of this Agreement is the date Customer agrees to these terms or uses the Software 
(as defined below). Capitalized terms have the meaning set forth in the applicable 
Sections or in Section 7.

This Agreement applies to your use of the Software but it will be superseded by 
any signed agreement between you and Hortonworks concerning the Software.
 
1.  	License.

1.1 	License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
Hortonworks agrees to grant, and does hereby grant to Customer, during the Term of 
this Agreement, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right and license, 
to use the Software for Customer's internal business use without the right to grant 
or authorize sublicenses or to further distribute the Software. Customer may make 
up to two copies of the Software for backup and/or archival purposes.

1.2	License Restrictions.  Customer shall not itself, or through any parent, subsidiary, 
affiliate, agent or other third party:
1.2.1	sell, lease, license, distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer in whole or 
in part, any Software or the DocumentaÂ¨tion to a third party; or
1.2.2	decompile, disassemble, translate, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to derive 
source code from the Software, in whole or in part, nor will Customer use any mechanical, 
electronic or other method to trace, decompile, disassemble, or identify the source code 
of the Software or encourage others to do so, except to the limited extent, if any, that 
applicable law permits such acts notwithstanding any contractual prohibitions, provided, 
however, before Customer exercises any rights that Customer believes to be entitled to 
based on mandatory law, Customer shall provide Hortonworks with thirty (30) days prior 
written notice and provide all reasonably requested information to allow Hortonworks to 
assess Customer's claim and, at Hortonworks' sole discretion, to provide alternatives that 
reduce any adverse impact on Hortonworks' intellectual property or other rights; or
1.2.3	allow access or permit use of the Software by any users other than Customer's 
employees, or authorized third-party contractors who are providing services to Customer 
and agree in writing to abide by the terms of this Agreement, provided further that Customer 
shall be liable for any failure by such employees and third-party contractors to comply 
with the terms of this Agreement; or
1.2.4	create, develop, license, install, use, or deploy any third party software or 
services to circumvent, enable, modify or provide access, permissions or rights which 
violate the technical restrictions of the Software; or
1.2.5	modify or create derivative works based upon the Software; or
1.2.6	disclose the results of any benchmark test of the Software to any third party 
without Hortonworks' prior written approval, unless otherwise expressly permitted herein, 
provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall apply to Customer only if 
Customer is a software or hardware vendor, or Customer is performing testing or benchmarking 
on the Software at the direction of, or on behalf of, a software or hardware vendor.

1.3	Other Software.  The Other Software is licensed to Customer under the terms of the 
applicable third party or open source license conditions and/or copyright notices.

1.4	Support.  Hortonworks does not provide any support or subscription services for 
the Software under this Agreement. You have no rights to any updates, upgrades or 
extensions or enhancements to the Software developed by Hortonworks unless you separately 
purchase Hortonworks support or subscription services. These support or subscription services 
are subject to Hortonworks' then-current support terms and conditions.

2.	Confidentiality. For a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of 
the applicable Confidential Information, Customer  will (i) hold the Confidential Information 
in trust and confidence and avoid the disclosure or release thereof to any other person 
or entity by using the same degree of care as it uses to avoid unauthorized use, disclosure, 
or dissemination of its own Confidential Information of a similar nature, but not less 
than reasonable care, and (ii) not use the Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever 
except as expressly contemplated under this Agreement; provided that, to the extent the 
Confidential Information constitutes a trade secret under law, Customer agrees to protect 
such information for so long as it qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law. 
Customer will disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its employees and 
contractors having a need to know such Confidential Information and will take all reasonable 
precautions to ensure that such employees and contractors comply with the provisions of 
this Section. The obligations of Customer under this Section will not apply to information 
that Customer can demonstrate (i) was in its possession at the time of disclosure and without 
restriction as to confidentiality, (ii) at the time of disclosure is generally available 
to the public or after disclosure becomes generally available to the public through no breach 
of agreement or other wrongful act by Customer, (iii) has been received from a third party 
without restriction on disclosure and without breach of agreement by Customer, or (iv) is 
independently developed by Customer without regard to the Confidential Information. 
In addition, Customer may disclose Confidential Information as required to comply with 
binding orders of governmental entities that have jurisdiction over it; provided that 
Customer gives Hortonworks reasonable written notice to allow Hortonworks to seek a 
protective order or other appropriate remedy, discloses only such Confidential Information 
as is required by the governmental entity, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to 
obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information disclosed.

3.	Ownership. Hortonworks and its licensors shall retain all intellectual property and 
proprietary rights in the Software, Documentation, and related works, including but not 
limited to any derivative work of the foregoing.

4.	Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability.

4.1	Disclaimer. THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER "AS-IS" AND 
HORTONWORKS AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, 
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

ARE NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN THE PLANNING, CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE,

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED 
BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

as set forth in this Agreement ("Term"). Either party may terminate this Agreement: 
(a) with ten (10) days prior written notice to the other party; or

records relating to its reproduction and use of the Software for the purposes of verifying 
Customer's compliance with this Agreement.  Customer shall cooperate fully with Hortonworks 
and its auditors in conducting audits and provide reasonable assistance.  If an underpayment 
is discovered, Customer shall promptly pay such amount and Customer shall reimburse Hortonworks 
for the cost of the audit. 
6.	General.  Neither party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations 
hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably 
withheld, and any such assignment in violation of this Section shall be void, except that 
(i) either party may assign this Agreement or rights granted hereunder to an Affiliate without 
the consent of the other party and (ii) the transfer of this Agreement or rights granted 
hereunder to a successor entity in the event of a merger, corporate reorganization, or 
acquisition shall not constitute an assignment for purposes of this Section. Affiliate means 
an entity that a party, directly or indirectly, controls, an entity that controls a party 
or an entity that is under common control with a party.  For purposes of this provision, 
control means ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting shares 
of the entity. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning 
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, 
proposals and agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. No amendment, 
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing 
and signed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or 
unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect and such provision 
will be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and 
will be reformed to the extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 
No waiver of rights by either party may be implied from any actions or failures to enforce 
rights under this Agreement. Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or 
failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable control (excluding payment of 
monies due). Unless otherwise specifically stated, the terms of this Agreement are intended 
to be and are solely for the benefit of Hortonworks and Customer and do not create any right 
in favor of any third party. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of 
New York, without reference to the principles of conflicts of law. The provisions of the 
Uniform Computerized Information Transaction Act and United Nations Convention on Contracts 
for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement. The parties will 
attempt to resolve any dispute related to this Agreement informally, initially through 
their respective management, and then by non-binding mediation in New York County, New York.  
Any litigation related to this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts 
located in New York County, New York, and only in those courts and each party irrevocably 
waives any objections to such venue. All notices must be in writing and will be effective 
three (3) days after the date sent to the address shown above for Hortonworks and given 
on the Hortonworks website for Customer.

End User acknowledges and agrees that, as between End User and IGEL, IGEL and its licensors (including IGEL Technology GmbH) are the sole owners of all right, title and interest in and to the IGEL Software, and all Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) adherent or in connection with the IGEL Software are and shall remain the sole property of IGEL. All rights not expressly granted to End User are retained by IGEL and its licensors. "IGEL Software" means the object code form of the IGEL proprietary software solutions, including "IGEL OS", the "Universal Management Suite" ("IGEL UMS") and/or the "IGEL Enterprise Management Upgrade Pack" ("IGEL EMP") licensed to End User under this EULA, together with any Updates thereto and Documentation. The full use of the IGEL Software requires the purchase of a Delivery Token as further described in Section 2 below. "Documentation" means, collectively, the official, published IGEL Software operation instructions, release notes and user manuals for the IGEL Software, in electronic or written form, that IGEL has provided or otherwise made available to End User. "Intellectual Property Rights" means all past, present, and future rights of the following types, which may exist or be created under the laws and acts of any jurisdiction in the world: (a) rights associated with utility models and designs, works of authorship, including copyrights, moral rights, and mask work rights; (b) registered and unregistered trademark and trade name rights and similar rights; (c) trade secret rights; (d) patent, industrial property rights, and certain technical and non-technical know-how; (e) other proprietary rights in intellectual property of every kind

and nature; and (f) rights in or relating to registrations, renewals, extensions, continuations, combinations, divisions, and reissues of, and applications for, any of the rights referred to in parts (a) through (e) of this sentence.
2. Obtaining and Using IGEL Software. End User obtains IGEL Software, whether as a preinstalled release or as executable installation files, in different ways, for example via a software download or preinstalled on an IGEL Hardware Product. All non-licensed releases (i.e., without any unlocked features) and executable installation files have greatly reduced usability. The fully-intended use of the IGEL Software requires a "License Key", a technically generated and unique letter/numbercombination, to obtain a productive functionality of the IGEL Software by unlocking the features of the IGEL Software through input of the applicable License Key inside the IGEL Software. The License Key can only be obtained via the "IGEL License Portal" or "ILP" by redeeming a "Delivery Token" (another technically generated and unique letter/number-combination) purchased from an authorized IGEL reseller ("Reseller") for the applicable License Key. End User shall purchase the number of Delivery Tokens for the number of purchased licenses of the IGEL Software, as well as purchase Support (as defined in Section 15), through a Reseller under a purchase order or other order document between End User and the Reseller where a corresponding order from an IGEL authorized distributer who is distributing to the Reseller has been accepted by IGEL (such distributor order, an "Order Form"). End User agrees to pay the amounts set forth in the relevant purchase order or other order form between End User and the applicable Reseller. Fees for Delivery Token for licenses for IGEL Software and for Support shall be invoiced as agreed between End User and the Reseller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, End User understands and agrees that fees for Delivery Token for licenses to IGEL Software and fees for Support shall be paid in advance of the relevant term covered. End User acknowledges that the Reseller and IGEL are independent of each other and that the Reseller does not have any authority to bind IGEL in any way, make any modifications to this EULA or to make any warranties or representations on IGEL's behalf and that IGEL has no liability whatsoever for any acts or omissions of any Reseller. An "IGEL Hardware Product" means any IGEL-branded hardware product that is purchased by End User through a Reseller. For clarity, IGEL Software may be included with or embedded in an IGEL Hardware Product (but is not included within the scope of the defined term "IGEL Hardware Product," as used in this EULA).
3. Subject to and conditioned upon End User's compliance with the restrictions and other terms and conditions of this EULA and full payment of the applicable Delivery Token fees, IGEL hereby grants to End User a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license, without rights to sub-license, to use the IGEL Software for which End User has purchased a Delivery Token for End User's internal business purposes and solely in accordance with the Documentation. Use of the IGEL Software shall be strictly limited to the number and type of licenses for either a specified period of time or perpetually (as further described in Section 5.1) as set forth on the applicable Order Form pursuant to which Delivery Tokens are purchased from IGEL.
4. End User may permit its Operators (as defined below) to access and use the IGEL Software solely for End User's and its Affiliates' (as defined below) benefit and only in accordance with this EULA and the applicable Documentation. End User shall be responsible and liable for all acts and
Page 2 of 12

omissions committed by it and its Affiliates, and their respective Operators, as if they were the acts and omissions of End User. End User may not allow any other party to access or use the IGEL Software (except as expressly set forth in Section 6 below). IGEL shall be allowed to take technical measures to protect the IGEL Software and/or with a view to agreed restrictions regarding the license and use of the IGEL Software by End User. End User is not allowed to remove or evade such technical measures. "Operator" means an individual employed by or who provides services as an independent contractor to End User or its Affiliates (excluding Outsourcers addressed in Section 6) and who is supported with or uses the IGEL Software for the sole benefit of End User or its Affiliates. "Affiliate" means any person or legal entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with End User or IGEL (as applicable); where `control' means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and operating policies of an entity through the ownership of voting securities (more than fifty percent (50%) of an entity's voting or equity securities, contract, voting trust or otherwise).

5.

License Models.

5.1. For licenses to the IGEL OS and/or IGEL UMS IGEL Software products, the license grant in Section

3 is (a) without restriction in terms of time and territory, and (b) limited to installation and use of

such IGEL Software on the number of endpoint devices or instances corresponding to the amount

of Delivery Tokens purchased by End User (hereinafter referred to as a "Perpetual License"). For

licenses to IGEL Enterprise Managements Pack (EMP), the license grant in Section 3 is time-

limited to the individually purchased duration specified on the Order Form and limited to installation

and use of such IGEL Software on the number of endpoint devices or instances corresponding to

the number of Delivery Tokens purchased by End User (hereinafter referred to as a "Subscription

License"). In order to unlock functions of the IGEL Software, it is required to input a License Key

inside the respective IGEL Software Product. Each License Key can only be used once to unlock

functions on a given endpoint device. To the extent that multiple instances of IGEL Software are

installed or executed (e.g. via virtual machines) on an endpoint device, each instance shall require

a separate valid license. End User may create copies of IGEL Software solely to the extent that it

is necessary to enable the unlocking of functions on the number of endpoint devices or instances,

corresponding to the amount of licenses purchased with Delivery Tokens, and to use IGEL

Software as intended. In addition, End User may create a reasonable number of backup copies of

IGEL Software as reasonably necessary to support its internal business continuity and disaster

recovery operations in the ordinary course of business. End User shall include on all such copies

all proprietary rights legends and notices of the IGEL Software.

5.2. If End User has IGEL Software installed on a data carrier provided by IGEL for this purpose (e.g., an IGEL UD Pocket), the purchased license also includes the right to temporarily download and copy the IGEL Software to another IGEL Hardware Product or a third-party hardware product. However, the simultaneous use of the purchased IGEL Software license on more than one (1) hardware product device, whether IGEL Hardware Product or a third-party hardware product, is not permitted.
5.3. If the IGEL Software is provided to End User by way of a download, the purchased license includes the right to copy or download the IGEL Software to an IGEL Hardware Product or a third

Page 3 of 12

party hardware product that meets to minimum technical requirements to operate the applicable IGEL Software.
5.4. License Portability. End User is entitled to transfer its License (which is bound to a certain Endpoint Device) to another Endpoint Device, if and as far as it ceases to use the unlocked IGEL Software on the originally bound Endpoint Device (e.g., via uninstalling the IGEL Software).
6. End User´s right of use under this EULA includes the limited right to permit outsourced services providers to access and use the IGEL Software (other than Test Software) within the framework of cloud or data center services contracted by, and solely for the benefit of, the End User ("Outsourcer"), provided that End User shall ensure Outsourcer´s compliance with the terms and conditions of this EULA and shall be responsible and liable for all acts and omissions committed by its Outsourcer as if they were the acts and omissions of End User, and any breach by any such Outsourcer of the terms or conditions herein is a breach by End User.
7. Pre-Release Software; Evaluation Software. If the IGEL Software provided under this EULA is software that is designated by IGEL (i) as any pre-commercial release software (e.g. indicated by the terms Release Candidate or Technology Preview, as described at https://kb.igel.com/licensesmore-igelos11/en/software-releases-overview-10325195.html) ("PreRelease Software"), and/or (ii) for evaluation or similar purposes ("Evaluation Software", and together with Pre-Release Software, "Test Software"), End User may exercise the license grant in Section 3 only for its own internal, non-production evaluation of the Test Software, and End User may not use the Test Software for any other purpose, including competitive analysis, commercial, professional, or for-profit purposes. End User acknowledges and agrees that the Pre-Release Software may not operate correctly, may be substantially modified prior to first commercial shipment, or may be withdrawn completely at any time. END USER'S DOWNLOAD, INSTALLATION, ACCESS, AND USE OF THE TEST SOFTWARE IS AT END USER'S SOLE RISK AND EXPENSE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS EULA, THE DOWNLOAD, INSTALLATION, ACCESS, AND USE OF TEST SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", AND IGEL DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS, AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE INSTALLATION, ACCESS, OR USE OF THE TEST SOFTWARE. The license grant Section 3 for Test Software expires 30 days after download of the Test Software unless otherwise agreed in writing by IGEL.
8. Third Party Software. End User acknowledges and agrees that the IGEL Software may be provided with certain open source software, as well as any other software products of third parties that are provided together with or in relation to IGEL Software (collectively, "Third Party Software"), as referenced in the IGEL Software itself, the Documentation, or on IGEL's website, for use in combination with the IGEL Software. This EULA shall not apply to Third Party Software, and the terms of the license documentation regarding Third Party Software shall govern End User's access to and use of the applicable Third Party Software. Such Third Party Software is
Page 4 of 12

distributed to End User solely under the terms set forth in the relevant Third Party Software license agreements (which are referenced in the IGEL Software itself, the Documentation, or on IGEL's website at https://www.igel.com/terms-conditions/), and End User acknowledges and agrees that this EULA in no way supplements or detracts from any term or condition therein. ALL THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. If and to the extent required by the applicable Third Party Software license, IGEL will make available the required source code for the Third Party Software in response to End User's request.
9. Termination. End User may terminate this EULA without refund at any time by ceasing to access and use and removing the IGEL Software from End User's environment, destroying all copies of the IGEL Software and Documentation, and providing written notice to IGEL. IGEL may terminate this EULA, effective upon written notice to End User, in the event that End User materially breaches this EULA and (if such breach is capable of cure) the End User fails to cure such breach within 30 days from IGEL's written notice thereof. Upon any expiration or termination of this EULA, the licenses granted herein will automatically terminate and End User must immediately remove and destroy all copies of the IGEL Software and Documentation, including all back-up copies. Any obligations to pay license, Support, and all other fees incurred prior to termination shall survive termination.
10. Audit. During the term of this EULA and for the longer of two (2) years after termination of (i) the EULA or (ii) the Support term for the applicable IGEL Software, End User shall maintain accurate and complete records regarding End User's use of the IGEL Software and End User shall (a) permit IGEL (or persons authorized by IGEL) to inspect such records and End User's computer equipment in order to verify that End User's use of the IGEL Software is in compliance with this EULA and that End User has paid the applicable license fees and Support fees for the IGEL Software; (b) if so requested by IGEL, certify through a director or officer of End User, that End User's use of the IGEL Software is, and has been at all times during the applicable license term been, in accordance with this EULA; and (c) permit IGEL (or persons authorized by IGEL) to inspect records regarding End User's use of the IGEL Software, whether through the provision of Support by IGEL using such tools and/or IGEL Software available to IGEL from time to time, or otherwise. IGEL may conduct an audit no more than once per calendar year (or more frequently if IGEL has knowledge or reasonable belief of End User's non-compliance with any material term of this EULA) and such audits shall take place during normal business hours and on reasonable prior notice. Without prejudice to any other rights and remedies, where such audit reveals any underpayment, End User shall immediately pay such underpayment to IGEL and where any underpayment is more than five percent (5%) of the amounts payable by End User for the audited period, End User shall promptly reimburse IGEL for the reasonable costs of the audit.
11. Intellectual Property Indemnification. IGEL shall (at its own expense) defend or settle any unaffiliated third party claim, suit or proceeding brought against End User alleging that the IGEL Software infringes upon any U.S. or Canadian patent or copyright of such third party
Page 5 of 12

("Infringement Claim"), and IGEL shall pay, indemnify, and hold End User harmless from any damages finally awarded to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction as a result of the Infringement Claim or any settlement of the Claim between IGEL and the third party. IGEL's obligations above are conditioned on End User (a) promptly notifying IGEL in writing of the Infringement Claim or threat thereof such that IGEL is not prejudiced by any delay in such notification, (b) doing nothing which may prejudice IGEL's defense of such Infringement Claim, and (c) giving IGEL the sole right to control the investigation, defense and settlement of the Infringement Claim and, if so requested by IGEL, End User providing reasonable assistance at IGEL's expense. If any Infringement Claim is made or in IGEL's opinion appears possible, IGEL shall, at its sole expense and option either: (i) procure the right for End User to continue to use the alleged infringing IGEL Software; (ii) replace or modify the IGEL Software to make it non-infringing; or (iii), if neither (i) nor (ii) are reasonably achievable, terminate this EULA, and provide End User with a refund of the license fees actually paid to IGEL for End User's affected IGEL Software subject to a straight line depreciation over a three (3) year period from purchase. IGEL assumes no liability for any Infringement Claim or allegations of infringement based on: (i) the combination, operation, or use of the IGEL Software with products, services, hardware, data or other materials not furnished by IGEL, if such Infringement Claim would have been avoided by the use of the IGEL Software alone; (ii) alterations or modifications to the IGEL Software by End User or its agents or at End User's direction; (iii) the failure to install any Updates made available by IGEL; (iv) End User's use of any IGEL Software after IGEL had provided End User with a subsequent noninfringing release of the IGEL Software or its replacement; (iv) use of the IGEL Software otherwise than in accordance with the Documentation and any Applicable Laws; or (v) if End User settles or makes any admissions with respect to an Infringement Claim without IGEL's prior written consent. THIS SECTION 11 STATES IGEL'S SOLE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY, AND END USER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OF ANY KIND.
End User shall (at its expense) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, or at its option settle, any third party claim, suit or proceeding brought against IGEL, its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers, and directors ("IGEL Indemnitee(s)") alleging that End User's use of the IGEL Software in violation of this EULA infringes upon any Intellectual Property Right of any third party or violates Applicable Laws, and End User shall pay all third party costs and damages awarded against the IGEL Indemnitees in judgment of such claim or agreed to in settlement of such claim between End User and such third party; provided that the IGEL Indemnitee(s): (a) provide End User with prompt notification of the claim, such that End User is not prejudiced by any delay in such notification; and (b) provide reasonable assistance in connection with the defense or settlement, at End User's expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, End User may not settle any claim without the relevant IGEL Indemnitee's consent to the extent such settlement requires the IGEL Indemnitee to admit liability, fault, or a wrongful act or conduct and/or otherwise requires the payment of un-indemnified money damages by the IGEL Indemnitee.
12. Confidentiality. Each party shall keep confidential, and not disclose to any third party (except each party's respective Affiliates, employees and consultants who have a need to know and who agree in writing to keep the information confidential on terms no less restrictive than those contained
Page 6 of 12

herein) any Confidential Information which may be provided in connection with this EULA.

"Confidential Information" means any non-public information disclosed by one party to the other

party, either directly or indirectly, whether communicated in writing, orally or by inspection of

tangible objects (including, without limitation, pricing, trade secrets, product plans, products,

services, customers, software including the IGEL Software (both object and source code),

Documentation, designs, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware

configuration information, marketing or financial information), which is designated as

"Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar designation. Information communicated orally will be

considered to be Confidential Information if such information is identified as Confidential

Information at the time of its disclosure, or if such information by its nature should reasonably be

understood by the receiving party to be confidential. Confidential Information will include this

EULA, any and all non-public information relating to any IGEL Software and any associated

training, Documentation, and other related materials, regardless of whether or not such materials

are marked as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar designation. Confidential Information

may also include information that is disclosed to a party by one or more third parties.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information will not include any information that: (a)

was publicly known prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (b) becomes publicly

known after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no fault of the receiving

party; (c) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the

disclosing party (as shown by the receiving party's files and records) prior to the time of disclosure;

(d) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party without a breach of such third party's

obligations of confidentiality; or (e) is independently developed by the receiving party without

use of or reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information (as shown by documents

and other competent evidence in the receiving party's possession). In the event Confidential

Information is required by law or lawful order to be disclosed by the receiving party, the

receiving party will first promptly give the disclosing party written notice of such requirement

prior to any disclosure so that the disclosing party may have sufficient time to seek a protective

order or other appropriate relief, and disclose only that portion of Confidential Information that

the

receiving

party

is

legally

required

to

disclose.

13. LIMITED SOFTWARE WARRANTY. IGEL warrants that the IGEL Software will not contain defects that cause the IGEL Software to fail to substantially conform to the applicable Documentation for ninety (90) days following the date of the applicable purchase order authorizing the License Token for the IGEL Software ("Warranty Period"). This Limited Warranty does not apply if the IGEL Software, IGEL Hardware or any other equipment upon which the IGEL Software is authorized to be used: (i) has been altered, except by IGEL or its authorized representative, (ii) has not been installed, operated, repaired or maintained in accordance with instructions supplied by IGEL or its authorized representative, (iii) has been subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, abnormal environmental conditions, misuse, negligence or accident; (iv) is licensed for beta, evaluation, testing or demonstration purposes or other circumstances for which the Reseller does not receive payment of a purchase price or license fee; (v) has not been provided by a Reseller; (vi) is not covered by an active IGEL EULA.

13.1. 13.2. 13.3.

Exclusive Remedy. IGEL shall use commercially reasonable efforts to repair or replace the nonconforming IGEL Software. This remedy is conditioned on the following: (i) End User reports the non-conformance in writing to IGEL during the Warranty Period, (ii) End User promptly provides any additional information reasonably requested by IGEL, (iii) IGEL is able to reproduce and validate the non-conformance, (iv) End User returns the IGEL Software and/or Documentation if requested as a condition of this remedy, and (v) End User complies with this Limited Warranty. End User acknowledges and agrees that this is the exclusive remedy and IGEL's sole liability under the Limited Warranty and a warranty claim may be performed and/or resolved by IGEL, IGEL's Affiliates or other third parties from within or outside of the United States. Limitations and Exclusions of Liability. In no event will IGEL, its suppliers, Affiliates or their Resellers be liable for the following, regardless of the theory of liability or whether arising out of the use or inability to use the IGEL Software or otherwise, even if a party been advised of the possibility of such damages: (a) indirect, incidental, exemplary, special or consequential damages; (b) loss or corruption of data or interrupted or loss of business; (c) loss of revenue, profits, goodwill or anticipated sales or savings; (d) loss of use, and (e) costs of procurement of substitute goods. All liability of IGEL, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors collectively, to End User, whether based in warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed the license fees paid by End User to any Reseller for the IGEL Software in the preceding twelve (12) months that gave rise to the claim. This limitation of liability for IGEL Software is cumulative and not per incident. Nothing in this Limited Warranty limits or excludes any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law. Disclaimer. Except as expressly set forth above, IGEL and its licensors/Reseller provide the IGEL Software "as is" and expressly disclaim all warranties, conditions or other terms, whether express, implied or statutory, including without limitation, warranties, conditions or other terms regarding merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, design, condition, capacity, performance, quality, accuracy, title, and non-infringement. IGEL does not warrant that the IGEL Software will operate uninterrupted or error-free or that all errors will be corrected. In addition, IGEL does not warrant that the IGEL Software or any equipment, system or network on which the IGEL Software is used will be free of viruses, vulnerability to intrusion or attack. This Limited Warranty does not apply to any Third-Party Software. This Limited Warranty supersedes any prior agreements or representations made in IGEL's and its Affiliate's sales literature or advice given by IGEL or its Affiliates, any IGEL channel partner, Reseller, or an agent or employee thereof ­ that may have been made in connection with the purchase of a license to the IGEL Software. No change to this Limited Warranty is valid unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of IGEL.

14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (AS DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY, ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR LICENSORS, RESELLERS OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF INCOME, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY OR PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, OR FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OF THE IGEL SOFTWARE INCLUDING UPDATES, DOCUMENTATION, AND THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, OR

Page 8 of 12

OTHERWISE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA, HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE). TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY, ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR LICENSORS, RESELLERS, OR DISTRIBUTORS EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID TO IGEL FOR END USER'S SPECIFIC IGEL SOFTWARE AT ISSUE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY EVEN IF A PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR LICENSORS, RESELLERS OR DISTRIBUTORS, AS APPLICABLE, HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LICENSE FEES REFLECTS THIS ALLOCATION OF RISK. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO END USER. MULTIPLE CLAIMS SHALL NOT EXPAND THE LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 14.
"EXCLUDED CLAIMS" MEANS (I) A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 12; (II) END USER'S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR IGEL SOFTWARE; AND (III) END USER'S MISUSE, VIOLATION, OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF IGEL'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
15. Maintenance and Support Services. End User may purchase maintenance and support services for the IGEL Software ("Support").

20. General. 20.1. Privacy Policy. End User's use of the IGEL Software and Support is subject to IGEL's thencurrent Privacy Policy, available at: https://www.igel.com/terms-conditions/. 20.2. High Risk Applications. End User acknowledges and agrees that IGEL Software products have not been tested or certified for use in any high-risk applications, including the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, air traffic control, emergency communications systems, life support devices, weapons systems, or any other application where the failure or malfunction of any IGEL Software can reasonably be expected to result in death, personal injury, severe property damage or severe environmental harm ("High Risk Applications"). IGEL makes no warranties or assurances that IGEL Software is suitable for any High Risk Applications and End User shall defend and indemnify IGEL Indemnitees from any claims made by third parties resulting from any such High Risk Applications. 20.3. U.S. Government End Users. Each of the components that constitute the IGEL Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and/or "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire the IGEL Software with only those rights set forth herein. If IGEL Software is acquired for or on behalf of the U.S. Government or any of its agencies, then it is recognized and agreed that the IGEL Software was: (i) developed at private expense; (ii) not required to be originated or developed under a U.S. Government contract; and (iii) not generated as a necessary part of performing a U.S. Government contract. 20.4. Assignment. Except as expressly permitted herein, End User may not assign, transfer, charge, sub-contract or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under the EULA.

However, Alert Logic does not interpret or segment data based upon its contents as a component of the Services it provides to End User. End User is responsible for ensuring that any End Data which should be protected or restricted on a need to know basis, such as PCI, PHI, or data subject to the Gramm-LeachBliley Act or classified government information, private individual data, personal data (as defined by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation) or other data that requires special or additional protections (collectively, all of such data "Sensitive Information"), is not sent to Alert Logic or transmitted outside of End User's network perimeter in clear text (or otherwise unprotected or unrestricted) format. If unprotected Sensitive Information is discovered by Alert Logic personnel in the performance of Services hereunder, Alert Logic will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify End User, to mask or purge such data from its records, and to work with End User to prevent such unprotected data from being sent to Alert Logic again or on an ongoing basis. As between Alert Logic and End User, End User accepts any and a ll liability for claims arising out of or related to any unprotected Sensitive Information that is sent to or otherwise made accessible to Alert Logic by End User.
6. Suspension of Services. In the event of any breach by End User of any its obligations set forth in Section 2 or Section 4, or in the event of Alert Logic's failure to receive payment for the Services in accordance with the terms of Alert Logic's agreement with the Reseller, then in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, Alert Logic will have the right, in its sole reasonable discretion, to immediately suspend any Services if deemed reasonably necessary by Alert Logic. Alert Logic will provide notice and opportunity to cure if practicable depending on the nature of the breach or failure. Once cured, Alert Logic will promptly restore the Services unless the Services have been suspended as a result of chronic breaches or failures, in which case, Alert Logic may terminate Services upon notice to End User.
7. Authority and Performance. Alert Logic represents and warrants that the Services will conform in all material respects with the functionality set forth in the Service Description linked in Schedule 1 hereto as such Service Description may be updated from time to time by Alert Logic. In addition, Alert Logic shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Services in accordance with the Service Level Agreement, if any, then in effect between Alert Logic and the Reseller; provided, however, that any remedy, credit, damages, compensation or the like owed or owing to End User for any failure by Alert Logic to provide the Services in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7 or otherwise shall be solely the responsibility of the Reseller, and End User shall have no claim or right to any remedy, credit, damages, or compensation or the like for such failure against or from Alert

Logic.
8. Data Processing Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Services for End Users may include processing, storing, and/or managing data which is governed by legislation relating to data protection and privacy including without limitation the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EE and the GDPR. To the extent applicable pursuant to such legislation for the provision of the Services to End User, End User acknowledges and agrees to the terms and conditions of such data processing procedures and services as are in effect by and between Alert Logic and Reseller (or as otherwise are then employed by Alert Logic) and any such Alert Logic Data Processing Agreement between Alert Logic and Reseller then in effect is hereby incorporated by reference herein as an integral part of this EULA.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 7, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, (A) ALERT LOGIC AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, TERMS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE. ALERT LOGIC AND ITS THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT CONCERNING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, SECURITY, SEQUENCE, TIMELINESS OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES OR ALERT LOGIC TECHNOLOGY AND (B) NEITHER ALERT LOGIC NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR ALERT LOGIC TECHNOLOGY WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SERVICES OR THE SERVER(S) THAT HOST THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ALERT LOGIC AND ITS THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INTERRUPTION OF SERVICES, DELAYS OR ERRORS CAUSED BY ANY TRANSMISSION OR DELIVERY OF THE SERVICES, DATA OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION OR CAUSED BY ANY INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER OR COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS. NO WRITTEN OR ORAL REPRESENTATION MADE BY ALERT LOGIC PERSONNEL OR OTHERWISE WHICH IS NOT CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE EEMED TO BE A WARRANTY BY ALERT LOGIC OR GIVE RISE TO ANY LIABILITY OF ALERT LOGIC WHATSOEVER.

THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION AND NON-RENEWAL OF THE EULA.
10. Consequential Damages Waiver. Except for the exclusions in Section 12 below, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will either party be liable or responsible to the other party or any third party for any type of incidental, exemplary, special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, loss of actual or anticipated revenue or profits, costs to procure replacement goods or services, loss, damage to, or corruption of data, business interruption, loss of use of service or equipment, or other pecuniary damages, however caused, even if advised of the possibility of such damages or such damages were reasonably foreseeable, whether arising under theory of contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, acts and omissions of the party claiming damages or the party from whom damages are sought or any other theory of liability.
11. Limitation of Liability. Except for the exclusions in Section 12 below, to the maximum extent permitted by
3

applicable law, and except for payment obligations under this EULA, the maximum total liability for any performance or non-performance of this EULA or for any claim by any End User arising out of provision of the Alert Logic Services, including without limitation in accordance with Section 8 of this EULA, shall be limited to an amount equal to the total fees paid to Alert Logic for the Services by End User or Reseller for End User's use of the Services, whichever is greater, in the one-year period preceding the date upon which any such claim first accrued.
12. Exclusions. The limitations in Sections 10 and 11 do not apply to: (i) nonpayment of undisputed fees; (ii) violation or misappropriation by a party of the other party's intellectual property rights; or (iii) gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud.
13. Alert Logic IP Infringement Indemnification. Alert Logic shall defend, indemnify and hold End User harmless against any loss or damage incurred in connection with any claim, suit, action or proceeding (each, an "Action") brought against End User or any of its affiliates by a third party contending that End User's use of the Services, or any part thereof, infringes upon a U.S. copyright or U.S. patent of such third party. Subject to Section 15, Alert Logic shall pay any damages finally awarded to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or final binding arbitration resulting from such Action or agreed to by Alert Logic in settlement of the Action in Alert Logic's sole discretion. In the event that the Services or any part thereof are likely to, in Alert Logic's sole opinion, or do become the subject of an infringement related Action, and Alert Logic cannot, at its option and expense, procure for End User the right to continue using the Services, or any part thereof, or modify the Services, or any part thereof, to make them non-infringing, then Alert Logic may terminate the Services and provide End User with a pro rata refund of the fees paid for the terminated portion of the then-current Subscription Term. The above defense and indemnification obligations shall not apply for any Action or demand arising from: (i) use of the Services not in accordance with this EULA; (ii) an allegation that does not state with specificity that the Services are the basis of the Actions; (iii) the use or combination of the Services or any part thereof with software, hardware, or other materials not developed by Alert Logic if the Services or use thereof would not infringe without such combination; (iv) modification of the Services by a party other than Alert Logic, if the use of unmodified Services would not constitute infringement; (v) End User's failure to install an enhancement provided at no additional charge that would have avoided the alleged infringement; (vi) open source software or third party services; (vii) an allegation of infringement deriving from End User's general use or exploitation of the Internet; (viii) an Action against End User that arises from End User's breach of this EULA; or (ix) an allegation made against End User prior to the execution of this EULA or any allegation based upon actions taken by End User prior to the execution of this EULA, or relating to any patent that, prior to the execution of this EULA, End User was aware may be asserted by a third party as the basis for a claim of infringement against End User or Alert Logic. End User represents that it has brought to Alert Logic's attention any such allegation or patent referred to in clause (viii) of the previous sentence prior to the execution of this EULA. The foregoing states Alert Logic's entire liability and End User's exclusive remedy for infringement claims or actions.
14. Indemnification by End User. End User shall defend, indemnify and hold Alert Logic, its affiliates, employees, officers, directors and shareholders harmless against any loss or damage (including reasonable attorneys' and accounting fees) incurred in connection with Actions arising or resulting from: (i) the scanning, testing and/or evaluation of incorrect or unauthorized IP Addresses that are provided by End User; (ii) End User's or any User's breach of this EULA or applicable law, including, without limitation, all federal, state, local and foreign consumer privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations; or (iii) any End User Data or End User's access, contribution to, or misuse of the Services. In addition, End User will indemnify and hold Alert Logic harmless from and against any and all costs and expenses incurred by Alert Logic to comply with any additional requirements imposed on Alert Logic or which may be required to protect Sensitive Information submitted by End User or its Users to the Services.
15. Indemnification Procedures. Each party's obligations under this Sections 13 or 14 shall arise only if: (a) the party seeking to be indemnified (the "Indemnified Party") promptly notifies the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") within thirty (30) days of learning of any Action for which indemnification is sought; (b) the Indemnifying Party has sole control of the defense and settlement of such Action, provided that the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in such defense or settlement with counsel at its selection and at its sole expense; and (c) the Indemnified Party fully cooperates with the Indemnifying Party at the Indemnifying Party's expense.
16. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this EULA due to any
4

cause beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of war, acts of God, earthquake, flood, embargo, riot, sabotage, labor shortage or dispute, governmental act, third-party discontinuation or removal from production of APIs used for Services, or failure of the Internet or telecommunications or other service providers (each, a "Force Majeure Event"), provided that the delayed party: (a) gives the other party prompt notice of such cause, and (b) uses its reasonable commercial efforts to promptly correct such failure or delay in performance. If End User is unable to pay for Services for fifteen (15) business days as a result of a Force Majeure Event, Alert Logic may terminate the applicable Order Form. If Alert Logic is unable to provide Services for a period of thirty (30) consecutive days as a result of a continuing Force Majeure Event, End User may terminate the affected Order Form and this EULA on ten (10) business days prior written notice to Alert Logic provided that such written notice of termination is given during the continuance of the Force Majeure Event.

2       License Grant

2.1     The PDF Library product is licensed under exactly one of the following license types.
You agree to abide by the restrictions listed below.

(a) Trial Download License

Under this License the PDF Library may be downloaded for free and used by You for a limited
period for development and initial testing. The intention is to allow You time to assess
whether the PDF Library is suitable for their purposes. Under this License, the PDF Library
MAY NOT be used outside of a development environment.

(b) CPU License

Under this License You are granted the non-transferable, non-exclusive and perpetual right to
link the PDF Library to part of an applet or product running on (or in the case of
applets, downloaded from) a fixed number of production servers - defined as a computer run by
You excluding the Development Environment. The price of this License depends on the total
number of CPUs used by programs linked to the PDF Library, not the number of physical machines
used. This License may be transferred between servers, provided that the number of server CPUs
concurrently running products linked to the PDF Library never exceeds the number of server
CPUs specified in this License Agreement.

(c) OEM License

(i) Under this License You are granted the global, irrevocable, non-transferable,
non-exclusive and perpetual right to link the PDF Library to products requiring the PDF
library as an integral part, and that are developed, marketed and distributed by You and
distributed to third parties. The price of this License is based on the total number of
products distributed that are linked to the PDF Library, including any non-free updates to
the Product. The products distributed by You and linked to the PDF Library must add
considerable functionality to the PDF Library. Programs, which in essence mimic the
functionality of the PDF Library, or a subset thereof, are expressly prohibited under this
License.

(ii) This License includes the right for You to sub-license to third parties the
right to use this PDF Library only as part of the product developed by You - any other use
will require a separate license agreement with the Licensor. This License specifically
excludes use which falls under the category of a "CPU License" as defined above.

(iii) You undertake and warrant that you will not reveal, divulge or disclose to any third
party whatsoever the key code of this OEM License and further undertake to embed the OEM key
code in a secure manner.

(d) Annual Subscription License

Under this License You are granted the non-transferable and non-exclusive right to link the
PDF Library to a website or intranet. The price of this License depends on the total number
of CPUs used by programs linked to the PDF Library, not the number of physical machines
used. Fees for this License are renewed annually as a subscription. This License may be
transferred between servers, provided that the number of server CPUs concurrently running
products linked to the PDF Library never exceeds the number of server CPUs specified in
this License Agreement.

2.2     Development License

In addition to the License grants defined in 2.1, an annual charge may apply for running
the PDF Library in a Development Environment. This charge will apply only while the Product
is "live" - it specifically excludes the period when the product is under development and
has not yet been released.


3       Copyright

3.1     You acknowledge that no title to the intellectual property in any part of the Product
is transferred to You. You further acknowledge that title and full ownership rights to the
Product will remain the exclusive property of The Licensor and its suppliers and You will
not acquire any rights to the Product except as expressly set out in this Agreement. You agree
that any copies of any part of the Product will contain the same proprietary notices which
appear on and in the Product (as appropriate).

3.2     The Licensor warrants that all intellectual property rights in the Product either
reside with itself or its suppliers and that the Licensor is entitled to enter into this
Agreement and that use of the Product by an Authorised User is not in breach of any third
party's intellectual property rights. The Licensor agrees to indemnify You against all costs,
claims and liabilities arising from breach of this warranty provided that you immediately
notify the Licensor about any alleged breach and render all reasonable assistance to the
Licensor (at the cost of the Licensor) in defending any such claim.

3.3     You agree that this License does not include ownership of the source-code for the PDF
library, which may be covered by a separate license.

written consent of the Disclosing Party. For the purpose of this Agreement, "Confidential
Information" shall mean all information about or belonging to the Disclosing Party that is not
a matter of public knowledge and all trade secrets and intellectual property owned or licensed
by the Disclosing Party. The restrictions of this paragraph shall not apply to any information
that: (i) is already rightfully known by the Recipient free of any confidentiality obligation;
(ii) is or becomes publicly known except through any wrongful act of the Recipient; (iii) is
independently developed by the Recipient without breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is subject

requirement, or order, to permit the Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to object to
the subpoena, requirement, or order and to allow the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek
a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The obligations described in this paragraph
shall survive termination of the Agreement.

order or having an administrator appointed in respect of your affairs (save as part of a

your computer system(s) and remove all license keys.

will not prevent it from doing so later in respect of a particular breach or any future
breach.

13.2    Any notice served pursuant to this Agreement must be in writing, addressed to a party
at the last known address for that party and sent by:

addressed) be deemed received upon the signature of the addressee; or
(b) by hand

13.3    Neither party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement insofar as that
breach is a result of an act of event beyond that party's reasonable control but if that
situation arises, the relevant party will make reasonable efforts to overcome that problem
as soon as reasonably possible.

13.4    This Agreement is not intended to benefit anyone other than the parties to it.

5.2. The terms of this Agreement apply to any Update and Upgrade, unless MoreApp provides different terms.
5.3. The support services provided by MoreApp will be provided during normal office hours of MoreApp by telephone or as web-based support.

6.1. If Licensee requires any changes (e.g. changes in the "look & feel" or changes in the availability in certain options) or additions (e.g. specific content) to be made to the Software prior to or after delivery of the Software, it needs to reach a separate agreement with MoreApp. MoreApp is not required to conclude such an agreement.
6.2. The changes to be made will be put in writing and undersigned by both parties (in a subsequent agreement) and annexed to this Agreement.
6.3. In case of changes and/or addition that parties have agreed upon, MoreApp will charge an additional fixed price, that will be laid down in the aforementioned subsequent agreement. Article 7 applies to the payment of this fixed price.

Unless otherwise agreed there will be no refund for unused Credits.

MoreApp will at its discretion charge Licensee using the credit card on file, direct debit, or if no valid payment method is added: send Licensee an invoice. Late payments are subject to interest charges of 1.0% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is less, plus all collection expenses. In event of any termination, Licensee will pay the unpaid balance due calculated in accordance with this Agreement. MoreApp may charge such unpaid fees and charges to Licensee's credit card or otherwise bill Licensee for such unpaid fees and charges.
7.5. Payments made by Licensee under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Services in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by MoreApp, Licensee must pay to MoreApp the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed. In that case, Licensee will have the right to provide to MoreApp with any such exemption information and MoreApp will use reasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents as may enable Licensee to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid from any relevant revenue authority if such a refund or credit is available.

8.1. All IP Rights with respect to the Service and the Software and all documentation provided by MoreApp to Licensee are solely held by MoreApp or its licensors. Licensee will respect all such IP Rights. Licensee shall only acquire the rights of use granted in this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions as stated herein.
8.2. MoreApp shall be allowed to take (additional) technical measures to protect the Software. Licensee is not allowed to remove or evade such technical measures.
8.3. MoreApp shall indemnify Licensee against any third party claim stating that the Software infringes intellectual property rights of third parties on the condition that Licensee immediately informs MoreApp in writing (which can also mean by email) about the existence and contents of such claim and will let MoreApp handle the matter completely, including but not limited to negotiating and agreeing to any settlements. In this respect Licensee shall provide - at first request by MoreApp ­ all necessary powers of attorney, information and cooperation to defend - if necessary, in the Licensee's name - against such third party claims.
8.4. If it has been established in court as an incontrovertible fact that the Software and/or documentation of MoreApp infringes any intellectual property right held by a third party, MoreApp shall ­ at it's sole discretion ­ (a) change the Software to the extent that it does not infringe such third party rights, (b) provide different software with similar functionality that does not infringe such third party rights, (c) at its expense acquire a license from such third party in order for the Licensee and/or its End Users to continue using the Software, (d) or provide any other reasonable solution to Licensee and/or its End Users. Any further liability of MoreApp with respect to infringement of third party rights is excluded.
9. Term, termination and consequences of termination
9.1. This Agreement will continue so long as Licensee is registered with MoreApp or until termination.
9.2. MoreApp may suspend or terminate this Agreement and Licensee's account immediately, with respect to the Service and the Software, if Licensee or End User fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the End User License Agreement, including any failure to pay fees when due.
9.3. MoreApp may terminate this Agreement and Licensee's account by giving notice to Licensee one (1) month before it intends to suspend or terminate this Agreement and Licensee's account.
9.4. MoreApp is allowed to terminate this Agreement in writing (which can also mean by e-mail) with immediate effect in the event: (a) Licensee becomes bankrupt or insolvent and/or if the business of Licensee is placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee, whether by voluntary act of Licensee or otherwise; or (b) Licensee enters into liquidation or shall enter into an arrangement or composition with its creditors; or (c) Licensee fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
9.5. Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving notice to MoreApp.
9.6. Upon termination - on whatever grounds and for whatever cause - all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement will expire automatically and immediately. All fees paid by the Licensee remain due and payable. All outstanding invoices will be immediately due and payable. Licensee must at its own cost: cease using (and require all End Users, and anyone else to cease using) all the Software.
9.7. Unless the Agreement or Licensee's account is terminated on the ground of article 9.3, Licensee will not be entitled to credits or refunds for any unused portion of this Agreement, including but not limited to unused maintenance and support. If the Agreement or Licensee's account is terminated on the ground of article 9.3, MoreApp will refund Licensee for any unused Credits remaining in the Credit Bundle or the remaining part of an already charged Monthly Plan. The refund will be paid in the same manner as the Credits or Monthly Plan were paid for.
9.8. Within the context of possible termination of the Agreement MoreApp will assess whether it is possible and desirable that MoreApp or a third party will conclude (new) agreements with End Users directly on the basis of which those End Users can continue the use of the Service. If the aforementioned situation arises Licensee states that it will agree with the concluding of new agreements and will fully cooperate if necessary thereto.
10. Processing of (personal) data
10.1. The performance of the Agreement will amount to the processing of personal data in respect of which Licensee and/or its customers are the controller as defined by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). MoreApp is in that regard deemed to be processor in the meaning of the GDPR.
10.2. All processing of personal data by MoreApp will be in accordance with the Data Processing Addendum, and therefore in accordance with the GDPR, which is attached as Annex 2 to this Agreement.
11. Confidentiality
11.1. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 5.4 above, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains ("Receiving Party") from the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.

11.2. Any MoreApp technology and performance information relating to the Products shall be deemed Confidential Information of MoreApp without any marking or further designation.
11.3. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information; or (v) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).
11.4. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
11.5. For clarity, no Feedback will be deemed confidential information and nothing in this Agreement limits MoreApp's right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.
11.6. Parties undertake to require the members of their staff and their subcontractors to observe these confidentiality provisions as well as to require the staff (including temporarily deployed third parties) that is charged with the performance of this Agreement to observe all reasonable (precautionary) measures.
11.7. MoreApp may identify Licensee (by name and or logo) as a customer in promotional material. Licensee may request that MoreApp cease identifying Licensee at any time by submitting an email to info@moreapp.com. Requests may take 30 days to process.
12. Limitation of liability
12.1. The total liability of MoreApp for failing to perform its obligations under this Agreement shall be limited to compensating direct damages, up to at most the license fees or Credits paid by Licensee during one year (exclusive of VAT). Direct damage shall exclusively mean: a. reasonable expenses which the Licensee would have to incur to make MoreApp's Services perform to the Agreement. These alternative damages shall not be compensated if the Agreement is rescinded by Licensee; b. reasonable expenses incurred to determine the cause and scope of the damage, insofar as the determination relates to direct damage within the meaning of this Agreement; c. reasonable expenses incurred to prevent or mitigate damage, insofar as the Licensee demonstrates that these expenses resulted in mitigation of direct damages within the meaning of this Agreement.
12.2. MoreApp's liability for consequential damage is excluded. Consequential damages means consequential loss, lost profits, lost savings, loss of goodwill, damages as a result of business interruptions, mutilation or loss of data and all other forms of damages or injury not defined as direct damages.
12.3. MoreApp shall only be liable as a result of an attributable failure to perform the Agreement if the Licensee gives MoreApp an immediate notice of default in writing, setting a reasonable term in which the breach can be remedied, and MoreApp still attributably fails to meet its obligations after this period. The notice of default must contain a comprehensive and detailed description of the breach, in order to ensure that the MoreApp has the opportunity to respond adequately.
12.4. Licensee will indemnify, defend and hold harmless MoreApp from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to (a) any breach by Licensee (including End Users) of this Agreement, (b) any Licensee data, (c) any modifications of or combinations with a Product, or any service or product offered by Licensee in connection with or related to the Service or Software, (e) any representations or warranties made by Licensee (including End User) regarding the Service or Software to third parties. This indemnification obligation is subject to Licensee receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Licensee to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim, provided that MoreApp may participate in the claim at its own expense and Licensee may not settle any claim without MoreApp's prior written consent; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of MoreApp at Licensee's expense.
12.5. Neither party shall be liable hereunder by reason of failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder (except for the non-payment of money) on account of strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, war, acts of terrorism, fires, flood, storm, explosions, earthquakes, acts of God, governmental action, labor conditions, or any other cause which is beyond the reasonable control of the party.

In that case, the following articles apply, complementary to the License Agreement and Privacy Policy. The applicability of any data processing agreement or addendum preceding this data processing addendum or issued by the Licensee is strictly rejected.

Thank you for choosing Objectif Lune's software.
This End User License Agreement and Limited Warranty (hereinafter collectively the "License Agreement") constitute a legal agreement between the End User, either as a physical person or as a legal entity ("you"), and Objectif Lune Inc. ("OL") and describes your rights to use the OL software, including any stand-alone application sold as part of the software and all companion products, components, patches, updates and upgrades, and also including any computer software, PostScript® programs, media and all accompanying on-line or printed documentation (collectively the "Software"). The term Software also includes licensed components of other third parties bundled with OL's proprietary Software.

IF SELECTING "I DECLINE", YOU MAY NOT USE THE SOFTWARE FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. IF YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE, RESELLER, SERVICE PROVIDER, CONSULTANT, CONTRACTOR OR OTHER PARTY THAT INSTALLS THE SOFTWARE OR OBTAINS THE SERVICE ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THIS CONTRACT ON BEHALF OF THAT PERSON OR ENTITY.
COPYRIGHTS. - The Software is owned by OL, its affiliates companies or its suppliers and is protected by the Copyright Act (Canada), any copyright law and international copyright treaties. Therefore, you must treat the Software like any other copyrighted material except that you may make one copy of the Software solely for security backup or archival purposes or if it is essential for the compatibility of the computer program.

Any copies that you are permitted to make under this agreement must contain the same copyright and other proprietary notices that appear in the Software.
PROPERTY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. - You acknowledge that the Software in source code, its structure and organization form remain confidential valuable trade secrets of OL or its suppliers and that all OL libraries, source code, byte code executables and any other files (collectively the "files") remain OL's exclusive property or that of licensed third parties suppliers which are usually more fully identified in the "About" section of the Software Help menu. Therefore, you agree not to modify the Software or attempt to reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software. You also agree that you may not distribute any files (particularly but not limited to OL source code and other non-executable files) except those that OL has expressly designated. Nothing in this License Agreement permits you to derive the source code of files provided to you in executable form only, or to reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, use or distribute the source code of such files. This License Agreement does not grant you any intellectual property rights in the Software nor in any third parties' components licensed to OL and bundled in the Software.
INFRINGEMENT. - OL will, at its own expense, defend or settle any claim or suit against you alleging that the Software, when used in accordance with this License Agreement, infringes a patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right of a third party. OL will also pay all damages and costs that may be assessed against you by final judgment as a result of such an infringement under the following conditions: i) OL shall be notified promptly in writing of any claim or suit; ii) OL shall have sole control of the defense or settlement of any claim or suit; iii) you shall cooperate with OL in a reasonable way to facilitate the settlement or defense of any claim or suit; and iv) the claim or suit does not arise from modifications by you, or from combinations of products provided by OL with products provided by a third party, except as a combination occurring by use of the Software for which they were designed.
For more clarity, this indemnity undertaking by OL applies only to the Software content and excludes any infringement of third party's intellectual property rights resulting from your use or operation of the Software, or from development you made with the Software, including any workflow process developed by you with the Software functionalities.
If the Software becomes, or in OL's opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, OL will, at its option: i) procure you the right to continue using the Software; ii) replace the Software with a non-infringing product substantially complying with the Software specifications; iii) modify the Software so it becomes non-infringing and performs in a substantially similar manner to the original Software. If OL fails to provide any of the preceding options, you will discontinue any infringing use and OL will refund any fees theretofore received by OL hereunder with respect thereto less a reasonable allowance for use.
You hereby agree to keep harmless OL, its officers, directors and employees, representatives and agents of any claim or action from any third party, as well as any damages, fees, expenses including reasonable attorney's fees, relating to the violation of this section by you, including any third party's intellectual property infringement resulting from your use, operation or any development made with the Software.

WARNING - HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. - THE SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE OR RESALE AS ON-LINE CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE ("HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES"). OL AND ITS SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.
SCOPE OF USE. - The license granted to you under this agreement is a single device license only and not a multi-device license. Consequently, you agree to use the Software for your own customary business or personal purposes on a single instance of any physical or virtual computer system for which the Software was licensed. If you need to use the Software on more than one device, you must purchase additional licenses. Contact OL for applicable royalties and licensing terms.
EXCEPTIONS TO THE SCOPE OF USE. a) The following products can be used on any number of devices: Designer, OL Connect Send and PlanetPress Search. b) A Capture OnTheGo (COTG) user license can be used simultaneously on multiple devices if and only if the operator of these devices is the
same physical person. c) If the Software can or will generate, create or modify PostScript programs called Variable Content Documents ("VCD"), any VCD generated
by the Software is licensed on a per "licensed output device" basis (including, without limitation, printers, Adobe Acrobat Distiller, Aladdin Ghostscript, etc.). This means that any VCD generated by the Software can be used by any number of users as long as they use the VCD on only that single licensed output device. If you need to use the VCD on more than one output device, you must purchase additional licenses. In case of cluster printing systems (multiple print engines attached to a single Raster Image Processor (RIP)), each print engine needs to be licensed individually. Contact OL for the applicable royalties and licensing terms for distribution of any VCD. Note that this paragraph does not apply for PlanetPress Office's "Windows Printing", PlanetPress Production's "Optimized PostScript Stream" and "Windows Printing", PlanetPress Connect or PReS Connect.

You also undertake to protect transactional information and personal information that you may collect using the Software in strict compliance with any protection of personal information laws and regulations applicable to you in your jurisdiction.
OL, ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES ASSUME NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER REGARDING ANY VIOLATION FROM YOU OF ANY ANTI-SPAM OR PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION LAWS OR REGULATIONS.

OL MAKES NO REPRESENTATION NOR WARRANTY i) THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, ii) THAT THE RESULTS WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ADEQUATE, RELIABLE OR ERROR FREE, NOR iii) THAT ANY SOFTWARE DEFECT WILL BE CORRECTED.

D. Upon Licensor's request, Licensee shall furnish Licensor or an independent auditor chosen at Licensor's sole discretion ("Auditor"), within seven (7) days of the request, with a completed questionnaire provided by Licensor or the Auditor, and with a written statement, in a format required by Licensor, signed by a director of Licensee, certifying the accuracy of any information provided;

The aforementioned interest shall be payable even if an invoice was not issued at the time the Non-Compliance commenced. If a material license shortfall of 5% or more is found, Licensee shall also reimburse Licensor for the reasonable cost of such audit in addition to other amounts due. The obligations in this Section 3 shall apply to both Licensee's Non-Compliance and any third party's Non-Compliance.

4 DOCUMENTATION. One (1) electronic copy of Licensor's standard Documentation, describing Licensor's recommended use and application of the Licensed Software, will be furnished or made available on Licensor's website free of additional charge to Licensee by Licensor with the Licensed Software. Printed copies of any Documentation may be available for purchase from Licensor or its authorized distributors. Additional copies of standard Documentation may be available on Licensor's website.
5 TERM OF LICENSE. This License Agreement and Licensee's license for the Licensed Software is perpetual, unless a subscription/term license has been purchased by Licensee (in which case the term of the license shall be as set forth in the Product Order, specified in Annex 1 or Annex 2, or as otherwise agreed in writing between the Licensee and Licensor), and is subject to earlier termination as provided in this Section 5. If Licensee has purchased a subscription/term license, Licensee's license to the Licensed Software shall automatically terminate upon expiry of such subscription/term. Licensor may terminate this License Agreement and Licensee's license to the Licensed Software immediately by giving Licensee written notice of termination in the event that either (i) Licensee breaches any term or condition of this License Agreement and Licensee has failed to remedy such breach within ten (10) days of the date of notice from Licensor to Licensee or (ii) Licensee is wound up, has a receiver appointed or has applied for or enters into liquidation or bankruptcy or analogous process or processes. Termination shall be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies Licensor may have. In the event of any termination Licensee will have no right to keep, access, or use the Licensed Software or any copy of the Licensed Software for any purpose and Licensee shall destroy and erase all copies of such Licensed Software in its possession or control, and forward written certification to Licensor that all such copies of Licensed Software have been destroyed or erased. Termination shall not entitle the Licensee to any refund or reimbursement of any kind of previously paid fees. The rights and obligations of the parties contained in Sections 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, and other sections that by their nature are intended to survive, will survive the termination or expiration of this License Agreement.
6 SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE. Where Licensee purchases support and/or maintenance services, Licensee's initial support and/or maintenance term will begin upon delivery to Licensee of the Licensed Software and continue for one (1) year thereafter (or the length of the term if less than a year for any subscription/term license) unless otherwise specified in the applicable annual support and/or maintenance agreement, Product Order, or other written agreement executed between Licensor and Licensee. Where Licensee purchases support and/or maintenance for any Licensed Software, Licensee hereby agrees that it shall purchase such support and/or maintenance services for all of Licensee's licensed units of such Licensed Software product. Support and/or maintenance services provided by Licensor will be subject to Licensor's then current applicable standard annual support and/or maintenance agreement unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.
7 LIMITED WARRANTY. Licensor warrants for the Warranty Period (i) that if the Licensed Software is supplied via media, then the media will be free from defects in materials or workmanship under normal use and (ii) that the copy of the Licensed Software delivered to Licensee conforms in all material respects to the Documentation. As the sole and exclusive remedy for not meeting part (i) of the above warranty, Licensor's sole obligation shall be to repair or replace free of charge any defective media on which the Licensed Software is delivered if the media is returned to Licensor by Licensee during the Warranty Period. As the sole and exclusive remedy for not meeting part (ii) of the above warranty, Licensor shall repair or replace the Licensed Software free of charge so that it conforms with the warranty or, if Licensor reasonably determines that such remedy is not economically or technically feasible, Licensee shall be entitled to a full refund of the license fee and any maintenance fee paid by Licensee with respect to that particular Licensed Software. Upon such refund Licensee's license to use such Licensed Software will terminate. The warranty set forth in this Section 7 shall not apply if the defect in the Licensed Software is the result of: (a) the Licensed Software not being used in accordance with the Documentation, this License Agreement or with the platform(s) for which the Licensed Software has been designed and licensed by Licensor; or (b) the Licensed Software having been altered, modified or converted by Licensee or any third party except as may be specified in the Documentation; or (c) the malfunctioning of Licensee's equipment; or (d) accident or abuse; or (e) service by any unauthorized person; or (f) other software used by Licensee which has not been provided by Licensor or for which the Licensed Software is not designed and licensed for operation; or (g) Third Party Software (as defined herein); or (h) any other cause occurring after initial delivery of the media to Licensee unless caused directly by Licensor. The foregoing states the complete and entire remedies that Licensee has under this warranty. Licensor shall have no responsibility for any warranty claims made outside of the Warranty Period. The foregoing warranty shall not apply to any freeof-charge Licensed Software including updates, though issues with such software may be eligible for support under applicable support terms and conditions.
8 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The Licensed Software cannot be tested in every possible operating environment, therefore Licensor does not warrant that the functions contained in the Licensed Software will meet Licensee's requirements, that operation of the Licensed Software will be uninterrupted, or that the Licensed Software is error free.

CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain) - 
CollapsibleLists

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

breach of its obligations set forth in Section 5 (Confidentiality), and (c) either party's unauthorized use, distribution, or disclosure of the other party's intellectual property.

3. Standalone version
If PRé identifies the Software as a standalone version the End-User may install and use one (1) copy of the Software within its organization. The End-User can appoint any person within the organization as a user, and can change this at any time, provided that no more than one user is appointed at the same time for every License obtained by the EndUser and provided that the user is employed by or working on the basis of an assignment of the legal entity of the EndUser. If hardware is replaced by other hardware, a new activation code might be needed, and a new code may be requested. PRé may refuse delivery of a new code, if it has reasons to suspect misuse of the License or breach of the EULA.
4. Network version
If PRé identifies the Software as a network version End-User may install and use one (1) copy of the Software on its network server. The maximum number of concurrent users shall be specified in the order form or an attachment to this EULA.

End User License and Service Agreement - PRé Consultants | January 2019
9. Right to use data
The End-User has the right to use the databases, datasets or specific parts of such datasets (jointly: "Data Libraries"), that are provided by PRé to the End-User that has obtained a License. Such Data Libraries are owned by third party suppliers of PRé and are protected by intellectual property rights. The use of Data Libraries may be subject to the terms of use of such third party suppliers, which are published on www.pre-sustainability.com. In no event shall the End-User reproduce, disseminate or publicly display the Data Libraries as a whole or any substantial part thereof, as determined by their nature and quantity even in case of insignificant portions.
10. Restrictions
(1) End-User may not distribute rent, loan, lease, sell, sublicense, assign or transfer all or any portion of the Software or Data Libraries, or any rights granted in this EULA, to any other person or entity without the prior written authorization of PRé;
(2) End-User is not entitled to modify, translate, adapt, arrange or create derivative works based on the Software or Data Libraries for any purpose.
(3)The Software and Data Libraries enclosed may not be copied to be distributed in any electronic form and may not be published on the Internet. It is specifically prohibited to copy the Data Libraries into databases of other software packages without the prior written consent of PRé. End-User is free to print the Data Libraries in his/her own reports as long as it is expressly stated that (parts of) the Data Libraries are supplied by PRé, and these may not be published in any form.
11. Ownership
PRé Consultants B.V. and/or its licensors hold all intellectual property rights pertaining to the Software and Data Libraries. This EULA does not grant to End-User any ownership in the Software or Data Libraries. End-User shall not remove any proprietary notice of PRé or its licensors from any copy of the Software or Data Libraries. Any copy of the Software made by End-User in accordance with this EULA shall contain PRé's copyright notices.
12. Registration
PRé will send End-User a registration code after acceptance of a valid and duly signed order form and (if required) advance payment. This code enables End-User to install and use the Software and Data Libraries. EndUser is responsible for the proper installation and registration. During installation an additional activation code may be required. This code is generated by an internet application maintained and operated by PRé, and is based only on certain computer hardware characteristics collected by the Software. No other information is collected.
13. Service
Service ("Service") consists of: (1) access to all relevant Software updates and to Data Libraries that are released, within the term of this agreement and as far as reasonably possible, and (2) free access to the helpdesk of PRé. Helpdesk service means that the End-User can, during business hours, ask questions concerning the working of the Software and the contents of the Data Libraries. Service is available to a designated contact person of the End-User only. PRé reserves the rights to have its helpdesk refusing to answer a question.
All Temporary Licenses include a Service contract for the term of such License. From the moment of expiration or termination of the Temporary License PRé will give no further Service in whatever form.
3

End User License and Service Agreement - PRé Consultants | January 2019
In the event of a Perpetual License, the right to Service is included at no additional cost during the first year of such License, which right will expire automatically after such first year, or, if the End-User has ordered Service for a longer term, after such longer term, save if (i) it is renewed for a new period by (tacit) acceptance by the End-User of a renewal notice of PRé or a partner at the prices and period specified in the order form or the price and period stated in the renewal notice (whichever is applicable) and (ii) payment of the fee related to the renewal. If Service is not renewed by the procedure described in the previous sentence, further Software and Data Libraries updates can only be obtained by purchasing a newer version of the Software and Data Libraries.
PRé reserves the right to adjust its prices for Service. The price of Service will be established by PRé once per year. EndUser accepts that software specifications can change with each update. If End-User sends data to PRé, PRé will keep all data and information strictly confidential.
14. Partner terms and conditions
Notwithstanding the terms of this EULA, the End-User acknowledges that if the Software is provided by a partner of PRé to the End-User, such partner is responsible for the provision of the (Temporary or Perpetual) License or any Service and that PRé cannot be held liable by the End-User for the provision of the Software or Service. A contractual relationship between the partner and the End-User with respect to the provision of the Software and Service exists. Partner might use its own (sales) terms and conditions. PRé cannot accept any responsibility for any commitment whatsoever made by the partner. Partner will send invoices to End-User. If End-User does not pay the amount due to the partner, PRé is entitled to terminate the right to Service. End-User will hold PRé harmless for any claim, any compensation of damages relating in any way directly or indirectly to the partner and any product provided by a partner, and hereby indemnifies PRé for any such liability or damages.
In such event:
a. the sole obligation of PRé towards such End-User is to permit the use of the Software and Data Libraries, provided that the Software and Data Libraries are used in accordance with the terms of (i) the agreement between de End-User and the partner and (ii) this EULA; and
b. the End-User is bound towards PRé by the limitations regarding the use of the Software, Data Libraries and Services as described in this EULA; and
c. PRé has the right to invoke the limitations, referred to under b. against the End-User.
In the event that the agreement between the End-User and the partner terminates and such termination is not caused by a breach of the End-User, this section 14 will cease to apply and the EULA will apply fully between PRé and the EndUser, subject to the provision in the next sentence. If PRé notifies the End-User within one (1) month from the termination of the agreement between the partner and the End-User, stating that PRé does not accept such full applicability: (i) PRé has the right to terminate the use of the Software and Services by the End-User immediately and (ii) PRé has the right to claim any amounts, due by the End-User to the partner and the End-User is obliged to pay for the use of the Software and the Services after termination of the agreement between the partner and the End-User to PRé.
15. Payments
End-User will receive invoices from PRé if PRé delivers the Software directly to End-User. Invoices from PRé, must be paid within 30 days after invoice date at latest. If End-User does not pay the sum due in time PRé is entitled to terminate the right to Service and the End-User owes statutory interest on the unpaid amount, without any notice of default being necessary. If End-User still fails to pay the claim after being put in default, the claim may be passed on for collection. In this case End-User is obliged to pay additional extrajudicial and judicial costs, the sum of which shall be established at a minimum of 15% of the total outstanding amount. PRé is, such at its discretion, entitled to request
4

End User License and Service Agreement - PRé Consultants | January 2019
advance payment. PRé may appoint a third party to send invoices and collect payments and/or credit card payments on its behalf. Payments made to such partners will be considered as payments made to PRé.
16. Termination
PRé shall have the right to terminate the EULA if End-User, after being given proper written notice of default and setting a reasonable term in which the breach can be remedied, is in breach of any of its obligations under the EULA.
PRé may terminate the EULA by written notice having immediate effect, without any notice of default and without judicial intervention, wholly or in part, if End-User is granted a moratorium on payment, whether or not provisional, if the involuntary winding-up of the End-User is requested or if its enterprise is liquidated or terminated in any other manner than through restructuring or a merger of enterprises.
PRé shall never be liable for damages because of termination. The provisions regarding intellectual property, ownership, limitation of liability and choice of law and competent court shall survive the expiration or termination of this EULA.
17. Limited warranty ("garantie")
Any and all Data Libraries are provided AS IS without any responsibility or liability of PRé or its licensor and the End-User explicitly waives any right to claim damages from PRé that are caused by incorrect, incomplete or otherwise nonconforming Data Libraries. PRé warrants that the Software shall be free from material defects in materials and workmanship, and shall conform in all material aspects to the specification as described in the documentation for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery of the activation code of the Software provided that the Software is used in accordance with the description and/or ordinary practices and conditions. PRé does not warrant that the functionality of the Software will meet End-User requirements or that the software or the Data Libraries are fit for any particular purpose.
PRé does not warrant that the Software will run without interruption, or error free, virus free or that defects will be corrected, that the Data Libraries does not contain any inaccuracies, or that advice, support or other information given by PRé or its partners does not contain errors. It is the responsibility of the End-User to make back-ups and to take all steps to ensure the Software or Data Libraries does not damage End-User's information or system. In the event that the Software does not comply with the warranty set out above and PRé is notified of such non-conformity within the warranty period, PRé, at its sole discretion, either will replace such non-conforming Software or will refund the total amount paid for the non-conforming Software as the End-User's sole remedy. PRé grants no other warranty, either express or implied.
18. Liability
PRé shall in no event be liable to End-User or any third party for any indirect damages and/or loss, incidental, special or consequential damages and/or loss or similar damages, including without limitation, indirect, special, punitive, or exemplary damages for loss of business, loss of profit, missed savings, loss due to business stagnation, loss of data, or loss of business information, arising out of this EULA or connected in any way with the use of or the inability to use the Software or the Data Libraries, or the provision of service, or for any claim by any other party, even if PRé has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
PRé's total liability to End-User for all damages, and losses of any kind ("schade") notwithstanding the cause of action (whether in contract, tort ­ including negligence ­, or otherwise) shall be limited to compensation of direct damage NOT GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE PAID LICENSE PRICE (EXCLUSIVE OF VAT). Liability of PRé will only arise if End-User informs PRé in writing of any default ("toerekenbare tekortkoming in de nakoming") and the damages
5

End User License and Service Agreement - PRé Consultants | January 2019
resulting there from as soon as possible setting a reasonable term in which the default can be remedied. Any notice of default ("ingebrekestelling") must specify the failure as detailed as possible, so that PRé will be able to respond adequately. The total liability of PRé for loss due to death or bodily injury or for damage and/or loss due to the intention or gross negligence of PRé, shall under no circumstances amount to more than the amount received from the insurance company in the respective case. Except for the cases referred to above, PRé shall not be liable in any way whatsoever for damages, irrespective of the grounds on which an action for damages might be based. A condition for the existence of any right to damages shall always be that End-User reports the damage and/or loss to PRé as quickly as possible after it arises.
19. Compensation
PRé shall defend End-User against any action brought against End-User to the extent that such action is based on the claim that any Software, when used in accordance with this EULA, infringes a copyright of a third party. The End-User must promptly notify PRé in writing of any claim and give PRé sole control of the defence and settlement thereof. The End-User shall provide all assistance in connection therewith. If the Software is finally adjudged to infringe, or in PRé's option is likely to become the subject of an infringement claim. PRé shall, at its sole discretion, either: (1) procure for End-User the right to continue to use the Software, (2) modify or replace the Software to make in non-infringing, or (3) refund the price paid by End-User for the Software, minus a reasonable usage fee as the End-User's sole remedy.
20. Compliance with laws
End-User must comply with all domestic and international (export) laws and regulations regarding the Software and the use of Data Libraries and with any end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by governments. End-User must at its own expense obtain and arrange for the maintenance of any government approval and comply with all applicable laws and regulations necessary for End-User's performance of the EULA. End-User will defend, indemnify and hold harmless PRé from and against all fines, penalties, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses incurred by PRé as a result of any violation of (export) laws or regulations by the End-User or any of its agents or employees.
21. Modification EULA
PRé reserves the right to modify this EULA for any new product or service release. By installing the new release EndUser accepts the new or revised version of the EULA.
22. Choice of Law and competent court
This agreement and any disputes arising out of or in connection with this agreement shall be governed by Dutch law excluding its articles regarding conflict of laws. Any and all disputes which might arise between PRé and End-User shall be exclusively submitted to the competent court in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

Foreword
 This guide supplements the presentation of a full day course by the DOA, State Bureau of Procurement, Software Licensing 101.
The guide reinforces the concepts discussed during the class ("What it is", "What to Look For") and provides actual examples of the practice of negotiating a software license.
Terms are displayed to show the difference between opening positions in a software license, the terms State agencies should attempt to negotiate, and additional tips on how to achieve a successful agreement.
This guide is not all-inclusive of all software license terms and the tips contained herein should not be interpreted as legal advice of any kind. Readers are responsible for their internal and external due diligence, and should work with their organization's authorized representatives and counsel on terms that are acceptable. BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB 
Key
(Original) This example is a starting-point clause, written by the Licensor, and needs work to mitigate risk to the Customer. Using the "What to Look For" tips, identify the changes you would make.
(Acceptable) This is a sample of acceptable negotiated language. It is either a real example of a final clause, or is one that was created for instructional purposes.
(Edited) This is a tracked change ("redline") version of a clause that is pending negotiation. The language is either a real example of revisions made to a license, or one that was created for instructional purposes.
2

Recital
 What it is. The "whereas" clauses ­ who's buying, who's selling, where's everyone from and what's being sold. Provides the purpose or description of the transaction.
What to Look For.  Make sure the "Customer" is as broad as possible to allow all
potential users to be included.
 Especially with an End User License Agreement or EULA, don't hesitate to strike and replace the Licensor's language completely (with explanation).
 Some licenses start the recital with a warning that if the Customer wants to use the software they need to accept everything in the agreement as-is without exception or they can't use it at all--this is not a reasonable opening position.
 Be specific about who the Licensor is, avoid multi-level company names.
Example (Edited)
IMPORTANT: BY INSTALLING OR IN ANY WAY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU OR THE ENTITY THAT YOU REPRESENT ("CUSTOMER") ARE UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE MADE A PARTY TO THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT OR SEPARATE CLICKWRAP AGREEMENT OR TERMS IN ANY SOFTWARE INSTALLATION OR DOWNLOAD (THIS "EULA") WITH BIG DOG AND ALL FUTURE REVISIONS OF SUCH EULA.
This Master License Agreement (the "Agreement") is between the State of Wisconsin ("State" or "Customer"), which includes all State of Wisconsin Agencies ("State Agencies") and the University of Wisconsin System and Campuses ("Universities"), as represented by its Department of Administration, located at 101 E Wilson Street, Madison, WI 53702, and Big Dog, Inc. ("Licensor") located at [COMPANY ADDRESS].
3

Definitions
What it is. Outlines the meaning of capitalized terms used in the license. What to Look For.  Use this section to achieve maximum clarity without needless
repetition.  There is no need to define ordinary words that are used in their
usual dictionary meaning.  This section should add value to the license and not contain content
that contradicts other terms used in the license.  Most important definition may be what exactly is being licensed
("Software", "Product", "Licensed Product", etc.). This definition should be broad enough to cover current and future use.  You may be tempted to use this section to clarify, once and for all, that Wisconsin is defined as the best state in the nation. This is not necessary (see second point above regarding ordinary words/meanings) but you will need to "Wisconsin-ize" the clause for Governing Law.
Example (Acceptable) Licensed Software shall mean the Executable Code version of the computer programs including all updates, releases, bug fixes, and enhancements to the Licensed Software.
4

License Grant
 What it is. The rules of what can and cannot be done by the Customer with the software. Typically includes version of software, types of users, purpose, manner and location of use. Identifies the type of license being purchased (perpetual, server, enterprise, etc.)
What to Look For.  Delete "internal" or add to definitions section and define very
broadly. Vendor does not have the right to define your business.  Licensor-defined scope of the grant is generally as narrow as
possible (limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable). Broaden the scope where possible.  Where the license restricts the Customer to the right to use only, add the right to "access and benefit from" the software.  Add the right to make backup or archival copies as needed.  If consultants or third parties doing work on behalf of your agency will need to use it, clarify that they are "users" and use is not limited strictly to employees.  Regarding source code, Licensor will be reluctant to allow Customer access to it.
Example (Edited)
Big Dog Software (Big Dog) grants to Customer a perpetual, nonexclusive, worldwide license to install, have access to, benefit from, copy, test, and display the Software on any hardware at any Customer site and to make backup and archival copies of the software as needed for Customer's internal business use only. There shall be no limit to the number of machines, number of users, number of locations or size of the hardware on which Customer can operate the Software. Customer may provide access to the Software by its authorized employees and consultants. Unless directed by Big Dog, Customer will not modify or create derivative works based on the Software; or disassemble, reverse engineer, or decompile the Software.
5

License Term
What it is. Addresses the duration of time you can use the software licenses (annually, perpetually, etc.)
What to Look For.  Typically written to maximize the potential revenue for the Licensor
over time. They are looking for language that affords a guaranteed revenue stream (e.g. autorenewals/ "evergreen" clause).  Retain ability to revisit the agreement annually (license may be perpetual, but support/maintenance are not).  Can be a negotiation opportunity (better price point in exchange for longer term commitment).  Term and "Termination" are typically found in the same clause, but they are different concepts and warrant clear distinction wherever possible.  Perpetual licenses should clearly ensure that the right to use the software continues even if the underlying agreement is terminated.
Example (Edited)
Customer is purchasing an annual license. The Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date date of mutual written agreement and shall renew automatically upon agreement and without either party providing a 30-day notice on the anniversary of that date of an intent to renew. Renewal is accomplished by Big Dog sending an invoice for the applicable Software license renewal fees and Customer paying the invoice.
6

Representations and Warranties
What it is. Assertion or representation of a fact, and the promise of certain action to be taken if the assertion is false.
What to Look For.  Typically says that the product is sold/provided "as-is"  Typically, the Licensor will not warrant anything, including a
warranty against non-infringement or a warranty that they have the legal right to sell you access to the product.  Clause presented in ALL CAPS, with many exclusions, disclaimers and statements to the Customer that if something doesn't go well, they are forewarned of the risk they are taking in using the product.  Make the clause readable with all the subsections you need (title, services, financial capability, IP infringement, operating environment, performance, viruses/illicit code).
Example (Acceptable)
Big Dog warrants: a) that it has the authority to enter into this Agreement, is not bound
by any agreement, obligation, or restriction which would interfere with the rights granted to Customer, b) that Software (including patches, updates and upgrades) shall operate according to the functional specifications and current Documentation, c) that Documentation accurately describes the functional and operational characteristics of software, d) that there are no pending actions or proceedings in law that Big Dog believes will affect any right, title or interest granted to Customer e) that the Software does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Right or other right of any third party f) that Big Dog owns the Software (including but not limited to all Intellectual Property Rights)
7

Viruses, Disabling Devices and Illicit Code
What it is. Malicious software coding that, when executed, can corrupt or destroy data and systems. Disabling code allows the vendor to remotely shut down access. What to Look For.  Unlikely that the license will have much content on this topic except
for a statement that they will attempt to prevent viruses.  Prohibit the Licensor's use of remote disabling devices and other
code that would prevent you from using the software in the event of a dispute.
Example (Acceptable) Licensor warrants and represents that no product or service provided to Customer pursuant to the Agreement will contain, when delivered, any virus, worm, trap door, back door, timer, clock, counter or other limiting routine that would erase data or programming or otherwise cause any software, system or equipment to become inoperable or incapable of ordinary use (a "Disabling Code").
8

Intellectual Property
What it is. Intellectual property (IP) is that of the Licensor used to create the software. IP is protected through a limited license grant that does not infringe on their ultimate ownership of the product.
What to Look For.  Licensor needs to warrant that they are the rightful owner of the IP
or has obtained the legal right to license or sell the IP to you.
 The license should be prescriptive about what happens to you as the Customer if another party challenges the Licensor's IP rights; such a claim is called IP Infringement.
Remedies (for Warranty Breach)
What it is. Contractually required response to an unmet warranty or other representation.
What to Look For.  Documentation of your express remedies if any contractual
warranty or representation is breached/not met.
 If you have no express recourse or remedy, Licensor will likely provide minimal remedies which will not make you whole for the damage.
Example (Acceptable)
Licensor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any Software not in compliance with this warranty. If Licensor is unable to correct the non-conformity (within reasonable period not to be more than thirty (30) days) within the initial six (6) months of the delivery of the software, Licensor will return the license and support fees paid to Licensor for the non-confirming Software.
9

Maintenance and Support Obligations
What it is. Maintenance and support is the service performed on the software over time to ensure it remains usable for the Customer.
What to Look For.  Clear obligations of the Licensor to include all patches, updates and
upgrades as part of your recurring payment of support costs.
 Avoid a URL to an online document about Licensor's obligations for maintenance and support, as they have sole control over changes without notice to you.
 Print or insert the then-current material from the online support terms and ensure that you receive service at or above that standard if the URL content does change.
 Ensure there is a clear understanding of the support standards based on severity level, and who in your organization is authorized to call for support as this may be limited.
Example (Original)
Maintenance and support for Software is not provided under this EULA. Maintenance and support, if purchased by Customer, is provided subject to Big Dog's standard purchase terms and conditions and support policies which may be found at www.Big Dogsoftware.com/vaguesupportpolicies which Big Dog will venture to meet. While the terms and conditions of support are not provided herein, by accepting this EULA the Customer thereby accepts without limitation or exception all terms and conditions for support and all fee schedules associated with the sale of support which are subject to change at Big Dog's sole discretion. The effective date for support and maintenance shall be the date the Software is made available to the Customer.
10

Limitation of Liability
What it is. Limits the amount and the types of damages that one party can recover from another party. What to Look For.  At a minimum, it should be mutual.  Damages should cover your direct and indirect costs and exclude
claims for bodily injury, damages recovered by licensor's insurance policies, breaches of confidentiality and representations of warranties.  In practice, work with your agency's legal counsel on the distinctions between indirect vs. direct damages, and the overall language presented on this topic.
Example (Edited) IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. NOTHING IN THIS PARAGRAPH IS INTENDED TO LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTY, OR DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR BREACHES OF THE OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. THE LIABILITY OF THE PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR A BREACH SHALL EXCEED THE GREATER OF (1) THREE TIMES THE FEES PAID, PAYABLE, OR TO BE PAID BY CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR (2) $1,000,000.
11

Indemnification
What it is. Promise by one party to cover the other party's losses if they do something to harm the other.
What to Look For.  This should be in addition to other remedies in the license.
 State agencies cannot indemnify, so this is a case where the clause should Z be mutual (Licensor indemnifies Customer). Check with your legal counsel.
 Licensor, however, will attempt to make this one sided in the other direction i.e. put all the risk on the Customer.
 Should cover variety of risks including infringement, unauthorized licensing, piracy and loss associated with misuse.
Example (Edited)
Licensor Each party hereto shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other End-User, and its shareholders, members, partners, directors, officers, employees, independent contractors, agents and Agencies affiliates from and against any liabilities, costs, fees and/or damages that arise out of any Indemnifiable Claim.
(IP) Indemnification Example (Acceptable)
Big Dog will defend, at its expense, a legal action, suit or proceeding against Customer to the extent that the Software infringes a valid U.S. patent or copyright provided (1) Customer notifies us promptly in writing of the Claim, (2) Big Dog has sole control over the defense or settlement, and (3) Customer fully cooperates with us. In the meantime, Big Dog will replace or modify the infringing Software or replace it with something as good or better at no cost to us and if it doesn't happen in 45 days we can end our relationship with no penalty and Big Dog will refund all the money we ever paid them.
12

Audit
What it is. Allows Licensor to verify you're using their software (intellectual property) as permitted under the license.
What to Look For.  We need reasonable notice prior to allowing a Licensor access to
records or facilities to perform an audit.
 There should be a limit to how often audits can be done.
 If the audit is performed on site, Customer sets the terms of access.
 If Customer is found to have used more of the software than what is currently licensed, a "true up" payment should be in line with the pricing terms from the original purchase (discounted, not list price).
 Customer needs to have a right to approve/decline a third party conducting the audit on the Licensor's behalf.
Example (Acceptable)
Upon ninety (90) days written notice and at its sole cost and expense, Licensor may audit Customer usage and compliance with the terms of this Agreement no more than once per calendar year. The scope of the audit shall be limited to a review of Customer's written or computer-generated reports pertaining to the licensed software. In the event Licensor's review of Customer's records is conducted onsite at Customer's premises, such onsite audit shall be conducted during Customer's normal business hours at the location designated by Customer. Licensor shall not be permitted access to Customer's internal network or any Customer hardware to determine the number of licenses in use by Customer without Customer' written consent. The audit results shall be jointly reviewed and approved by the parties. In the event Customer and Licensor identify use over the Customer's licensed amount, the parties shall reconcile such excess use at the lesser of either a) the rate and discount structure of the Customer's original purchase, or b) Licensor's then current price list minus 60.19% discount, and for no other costs, fees or penalties and per the Payment Terms of the Agreement.
13

Assignment
What it is. Determines whether rights and other obligations under a license may be transferred in whole (or in part) to another party.
What to Look For.  Licensor will want full flexibility to transfer rights and obligations
whenever, and to whomever, they intend to.
 Typically, language will contemplate the possibility of notice to the Customer, but not the requirement to provide notice.
 Need to be clear that notice is required, and all the duties and obligations must transfer to the new party under an approved assignment.
 Customer needs the same right to assign.
Example (Edited)
Neither party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the other party's written permission, which permission will not be unreasonably withheld. Licensor may assign this Agreement without being required to obtain a consent to any third party, including, but not limited to, a subsidiary or affiliate or to an acquirer of or successor to substantially all its business assets related to this Agreement and/or to the Software. In the event of an approved assignment, if the State encounters a degradation in service or an unwarranted price increase as a result of the assignment and the assignee does not cure such discrepancy for future purchases within thirty (30) days of being notified, the State may terminate the Agreement without penalty, and after removing the Software and returning it to the Licensor's assignee, be entitled for a pro rata refund, from the assignee (and not the previous Licensor, the assignor), of the license fee paid Licensor based on a three (3) years amortization basis.
14

Confidentiality
What it is. Defines what is confidential and proprietary information, how that information is protected, and what happens if there is ever a breach of that information.
What to Look For.  Licensor will pursue a broad definition of its covered confidential
information which typically covers both legitimate trade secrets but also information that is normally public under state contracts and law.
 Definitions rarely start with a cover for the Customer's confidential information or data, so this should be added. This clause should be mutual.
 Often includes stringent and costly requirements on the Customer to protect the Licensor's information; needs to be reasonable.
 Align the language related to "trade secrets" to applicable Wisconsin State Statutes, consistent with public records laws.
Example (Original)
Customer may not disclose Big Dog's confidential information to any third party unless Big Dog has given its specific and express prior written approval. Customer will protect Big Dog's information from unauthorized use.
Example (Edited)
Neither Party may Customer may not disclose Big Dog's the Other Party's confidential information to any third party unless Big Dog has given its specific and express prior written approval. Each Party Customer will protect Big Dog's the other's information from unauthorized use.
15

Order Forms
What it is. Document from a Licensor created to initiate or clarify a software purchase transaction.
What to Look For.  Will appear to be innocuous, but may contain additional terms or
links to terms that nullify your negotiated license and the protections afforded by it.
 Order form should match the pricing and discount terms negotiated for the purchase to ensure the Customer is not inadvertently overcommitting to something that was not agreed to in the license or other discussions with the Licensor.
 We need to be able to have our state standard terms related to payment and good faith disputes reflected in the order form, or have a reference on the order form that those terms will govern if they are found elsewhere (e.g. in your license itself).
Example (Acceptable)
The parties to this Contract understand and agree that standard forms or templates may be used for various purposes, including but not limited to, purchase orders, invoices, quotes, `Website Terms and/or Conditions' or `click to accept' agreement(s), some of which may contain boilerplate or standard terms and conditions ("Other Documents"). However, any use of Other Documents is not a part of this Contract and is deemed to be for administrative convenience only and the terms therein are of no effect, have no force of law and do not modify the terms of this Contract.
Example (Original)
Big Dog may submit a quote to Customer containing quantity, pricing and other ordering information ("Quote"). Customer will be deemed to have accepted a Quote when Customer receives it. Customer agrees that any terms and conditions inconsistent with or in addition to this EULA (except Big Dog's hyperlinked terms, which do apply), including
16

without limitation any PO terms and conditions, are rejected and null and of no effect, even if Big Dog accepts, acknowledges or makes Software available in response to the Order.
17

Fees, Changes and Payment Terms
What it is. Terms outlining timing and conditions of payment, and terms of allowable fee increases.
What to Look For.  If increases are allowable, they must be reasonable and subject to
prior notice, negotiation and express approval.
 Watch for penalties and back payments for reinstatement of software support and maintenance if the Customer has a lapse in time during which is not covered by a current maintenance and support agreement.
 Payment terms should mirror state standards and be conditioned upon acceptance of the software, not just delivery. If tied to acceptance, be prepared to clarify with the Licensor what you define as "accepted".
Example (Original)
Customer shall pay the purchase price and all fees as determined by Big Dog. Big Dog reserves the right to increase or change fees and other charges at its sole discretion and may endeavor to notify Customer by posting the fee structure to www.Big Dogsoftware.com/increaseatanytime. Customer authorizes Big Dog to make any resulting billing increases. Further, Customer acknowledges that Big Dog provided such quote in consideration of the inherent risk in the pending transaction and any attempt by the Customer to revise or change any terms included in this EULA inherently increases risks incurred by Big Dog in the transaction, and Big Dog reserves the right to increase the current Quote to reflect these risks.
18

Termination
 What it is. Clause outlining the terms under which a license can be terminated and for what reasons.
What to Look For.  If a license grant is truly perpetual, termination should not have an
effect on the perpetual nature of Customer's use.
 These rights must be mutual and provide for written advanced notice, and a right to cure any problems.
 Typically, the starting language will offer only the Licensor the ability to terminate, and that right will be broad.
 Should clarify the difference between a termination for cause vs. one for convenience.
Example (Edited)
The Permanent License shall be perpetual, unless terminated by Licensor as set forth herein. Either Party Licensor may terminate this Agreement upon the breach by a Party you of any term hereof subject to a thirty seven (307) days prior written notice to be sent by Licensor and opportunity to cure any alleged breach. Any termination of this Agreement shall also terminate the Temporary License and/or Permanent License granted hereunder. Upon termination of this Agreement and/or License for any reason, you agree to destroy and remove from all computers, hard drives, networks, and other storage media all copies of the Software and Documentation and, at the request of Licensor, shall so certify to Licensor that such actions have been performed.
19

Severability
 What it is. Concept that if one clause of the license is proven unlawful or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the unaffected terms remain in place. (Not to be confused with "survivability").
Survivability
What it is. Identification of the terms that remain in effect even after your contract ends.
Non-Appropriation
 What it is. Right of the Customer to cancel the agreement if the legislature does not appropriate funds to support continuing to pay.
What to look for.  Some agreements require the Customer to not purchase a
competing product for a certain period after a cancelation for nonappropriation, or to certify that you will not in some way attempt to lobby the legislature to not appropriate funds for the payment to the detriment of the Licensor; these should be removed (see next point below).
 Any language that tries to re-define what non-appropriation means and/or adds conditions on the Customer should be removed, as an agency does not control this circumstance.
Governing Law
 What it is. Determines the location of the court (and the laws applicable in that jurisdiction) that you would go to if one party sues the other.
What to look for.  Wisconsin! If this is a contention point during negotiation with the
Licensor, work with your organization's legal counsel.
20

Force Majeure
 What it is. A statement that a party is not responsible for fulfilling obligations due to circumstances beyond their control such as natural disasters, embargoes, terrorism, etc.
What to look for.  Mutual protection is important.  Ensure that if a Licensor is absolved from performing under these
specific circumstances, the Customer is not obligated to pay during this time.  If you find yourself disinterested in software licensing at any point and need a humorous refresher, seek out "clause 57.10 lumberyard game" for another take on access/use of software during a Force Majeure event.
Example (Acceptable)
Neither party shall be in default due to any failure in performance of this Agreement in accordance with reasonable control and without fault or negligence on their part. Such causes may include, but are not restricted to, acts of nature or the public enemy, acts of the government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes and unusually severe weather, but in every case the failure to perform such must be beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or negligence of the party.
Parting Advice
Software licensing is a complex topic and the practice of negotiating licenses is not easy. However, having a sound license to use software is just as important as having a sound contract for any other good or service. It is critical to protect our resources and mitigate risk.
So, let's partner--partner with your technical staff, your legal counsel, and the State Bureau of Procurement so we can all work better together.

modifications to avoid claims of infringement have been completed. User 
waives any claim against TPC in the event of such infringement claims by 
others.

THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL TPC'S OR ITS 
LICENSORS' LIABILITY OR DAMAGES TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON EVER EXCEED

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSEE'S LIABILITY OR DAMAGES TO TPC OR ANY OTHER 
PERSON EVER EXCEED $1,000,000, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CLAIM. Some 
countries/states do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability

Sale of Goods will not govern this Agreement. This Agreement is the 
entire agreement between us regarding the subject matter hereof and 
supersedes any other understandings or agreements with respect to the 
Materials or the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this 
Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable by any court having 
jurisdiction, that particular provision will be deemed modified to the 
extent necessary to make the provision valid and enforceable, and the 
remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

If You acquired the Materials in the European Union (EU), the following 
provisions also apply to You. If there is any inconsistency between the

warranties may be implied in contracts for the sale of goods and in 
contracts for the supply of services. Such conditions and warranties are 
hereby excluded, to the extent such exclusion, in the context of this 
transaction, is lawful under Irish law. Conversely, such conditions and 
warranties, insofar as they may not be lawfully excluded, shall apply. 
Accordingly nothing in this Agreement shall prejudice any rights that 
You may enjoy by virtue of Sections 12, 13, 14 or 15 of the Irish Sale 
of Goods Act 1893 (as amended). 

5. General. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of

representation made by it, its agents or anyone else (whether innocently 
or negligently) upon which You relied upon entering this Agreement, 
unless such untrue statement or representation was made fraudulently.Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) 4.0 SP2

Section 3.3 of this EULA is modified to add the following:
Nothing included in this EULA (including this Section 3.3) shall limit any non-waivable right to decompile the licensed software that you may enjoy under mandatory law. For example, if you are located in certain member states of the European Union (EU), you may have the right upon certain conditions specified in the applicable law to decompile the software if it is necessary to do so in order to achieve interoperability of the Software with another software program, and you have first asked Altium in writing to provide the information necessary to achieve such interoperability and Altium has not made such information available. In addition, such decompilation may only be done by you or someone else entitled to use a copy of the software on your behalf. Altium has the right to impose reasonable conditions before providing such information. Any information supplied by Altium or obtained by you, as permitted hereunder, may only be used by you for the purpose described herein and may not be disclosed to any third party or used to create any software which is substantially similar to the expression of the software or used for any other act which infringes Altium's or its licensors' copyright rights.
Section 10 of this EULA is modified to read as follows:
Subject to Section 10 as modified for Licensed Materials that are purchased in certain member states of the EU, Altium excludes all warranties only to the extent permitted by the law therein; liability for any breach of warranty is excluded except when due to Altium's gross negligence or intentional misconduct. A claim for damages arising from a defect in the Licensed Materials is only permissible if Altium fraudulently conceals such defect but in all cases subject to any statutory claims afforded to You by local law.

The aforesaid limitation of liability shall not apply to any mandatory statutory liability, in particular, to liability under the German Product Liability Act, liability for assuming a specific guarantee or liability for culpably caused personal injuries. You are required to take all reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages, in particular, to make back-up copies of the licensed software and your computer data subject to the provisions of this EULA.

THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE
The Software may include third party software programs that are subject to open source or pass- through commercial licenses and/or notices that GuardiCore is required to distribute with the Solution (such third party programs, "Third Party Software").

Any covenants, representations, warranties, indemnities and other commitments with respect to the Solution in this Agreement are made by GuardiCore and not by any authors or suppliers of, or contributors to, such open source or commercial programs. This Agreement does not modify or abridge any rights or obligations that Customer may have under the third party licenses and notices applicable to such programs. Any use or distribution of open source programs outside of their licensed use and distribution with the Solution under this Agreement, and any use and distribution of a commercial program subject to a pass-through license, is subject solely to the rights and obligations under the applicable open source or pass-through license. Any Third Party Software that is separate from, but delivered with, the Solution is provided and licensed solely under the applicable open source or commercial pass-through license for the program. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, GuardiCore does not make any representation, warranty, guarantee, or condition, and does not undertake any defense or indemnification, with respect to any Third Party Software.


OWNERSHIP
As between the Parties, GuardiCore is, and shall remain, the sole and exclusive owner of all Intellectual Property Rights in, to, and under: (a) the Solution and Documentation, as well as any Upgrades to the foregoing; and (b) the Support Services and any Professional Services. Any rights not expressly granted to Customer under this Agreement, are hereby reserved by GuardiCore.


PAYMENT
Customer shall fully pay the License fees set forth in the Purchase Order (the "License Fees");provided, however, that if a Usage Audit reveals a usage or consumption level above that permitted in the Purchase Order, the License Fees will be increased in accordance with GuardiCore's then-current manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), and GuardiCore will invoice Customer for the increased fees. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing adjustment mechanism shall not apply if the revealed usage or consumption level would result in lower License Fees being payable.  
Customer's right to receive Support Services is subject to Customer's payment in full of the Support Services fees set forth in the Purchase Order (the "Support Fees").
Payments shall be made in accordance with the payment terms and instructions set forth in the Purchase Order. Unless otherwise specified in the Purchase order, all payments shall be made in US Dollars, and without any right of set-off or deduction, and are irrevocable and nonrefundable. Any amount not paid when required to be paid hereunder shall accrue interest on a daily basis until paid in full, at the lesser of: (a) the rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month; or (b) the highest amount permitted by applicable Law.
All amounts payable to GuardiCore under this Agreement are exclusive of applicable taxes (including without limitation VAT), withholdings or duties, and the fees set forth in the Purchase Order Form are the net amounts that GuardiCore shall be paid by Customer. Customer shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes, withholdings and duties of any kind payable with respect to its access to and use of the Solution and its receipt of the Support Services, as well as any Professional Services arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (if any), other than taxes based on GuardiCore's net income.In the event that Customer is required by applicable Law to withhold or deduct taxes imposed upon Customer for any payment under this Agreement, then the amounts due to GuardiCore shall be increased by the amount necessary so that GuardiCore receives and retains, free from liability for any deduction or withholding, an amount equal to the sum it would have received had Customer not made any such withholding or deduction.

CONFIDENTIALITY
Each Party (the "Recipient") may have access to certain non-public or proprietary information and materials of the other Party (the "Discloser"), whether in tangible or intangible form ("Confidential Information"). Without derogating from any other obligation or restriction in this Agreement, Customer shall treat the Solution and Documentation as GuardiCore's Confidential Information. Moreover, the Parties agree that the terms of the Purchase Order are the Confidential Information of GuardiCore. Confidential Information shall not include information and material which: (a) at the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient hereunder, is in the public domain; (b) after disclosure by Discloser to Recipient hereunder, becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the Recipient; (c) was rightfully in the Recipient's possession at the time of disclosure by the Discloser hereunder, and which is not subject to a prior continuing obligation of confidentiality; (d) is rightfully disclosed to the Recipient by a third party having the lawful right to do so; or (e) independently developed by the Recipient without use of, or reliance upon, Confidential Information received from the Discloser.
Recipient shall use the Discloser's Confidential Information solely for the purposes of Recipient exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement. Recipient shall not disclose the Discloser's Confidential Information to any third party, except to its employees, legal advisers, and investors who have a need to know such Confidential Information in order for Recipient to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement;provided, however, that such personnel are subject to substantially similar written confidentiality undertakings as contained herein. The Recipient shall be primarily responsible for the acts and omissions of such personnel.
Recipient shall take commercially reasonable measures, at a level at least as protective as those taken to protect its own Confidential Information of like nature (but in no event less than a reasonable level), to protect the Discloser's Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure.
In the event Recipient is required to disclose Discloser's Confidential Information pursuant to any law, regulation, or governmental or judicial order, Recipient will (a) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such law, regulation or order, (b) reasonably cooperate with Discloser in opposing such disclosure, (c) only disclose to the extent required by such law, regulation or order (as the case may be).
Each Party acknowledges that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section(Confidentiality) by the other Party, the non-breaching Party may suffer irreparable harm or damage for which monetary damages will be inadequate, and will, therefore, be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance to enforce the obligations under this Section (without the need to post a bond).

TERM AND TERMINATION
This Agreement commences as of the Effective Date and will continue in full force and effect for the duration of the License Term, unless terminated in accordance with this Agreement.
Each Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other Party: (a) if the other Party commit a material breach under this Agreement and, if curable, fails to cure that breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice specifying the material breach; and/or (b) if the other Party is declared bankrupt by a judicial decision, or, in the event an involuntary bankruptcy action is filed against such other Party, it has not taken, within sixty (60) days from service of such action to such Party, any possible action under applicable Law for such filed action to be dismissed.
In the event Customer is seven (7) days or more overdue on any payment under this Agreement, GuardiCore may suspend access to the Solution and/or terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Customer.

EFFECT OF TERMINATION; SURVIVAL
The expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not affect the accrued rights and obligations of the Parties. Upon the effective date of expiration or termination of this Agreement, Customer shall (a) immediately uninstall and discontinue all use of the Solution and Documentation, and permanently erase the Solution and Documentation from all Deployment Environments; (b) promptly return (or, if instructed in writing by GuardiCore, destroy) all tangible Confidential Information of GuardiCore; and (c) promptly pay any outstanding amounts owing to GuardiCore, including, where GuardiCore has terminated the Agreement pursuant to Section ?13 above, all fees that would otherwise be payable for the remainder of the License Term, but for the termination. The following shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement: (i) any provision and/or right that is stated, or that by its nature is contemplated, to survive; and (ii) Sections ?8, ?10, ?12 through ?14 (inclusive), and ?16 through ?23 (inclusive).


WARRANTY
GuardiCore warrants to Customer that the Solution will in all material respects perform the functions described in the Documentation for a period of twelve (12) months commencing upon the Effective Date (the "Warranty" and "Warranty Period" respectively). The Warranty shall be subject to the Solution (a) having been properly installed and used at all times in accordance with the applicable Documentation, and (b) not being modified by persons other than GuardiCore or its authorized representative. Customer's sole remedy, and GuardiCore's entire obligation and liability, for a Warranty claim under this Section ?15(Warranty) shall be for GuardiCore to make commercially reasonable efforts to provide a fix, patch or workaround (which may be included in a future Upgrade) for reproducible defects in the Solution reported to GuardiCore in writing, all at no additional charge to Customer;provided, however, that (i) the Warranty claim is made in writing within the Warranty Period; and (b) GuardiCore determines that the defect is not due to any misuse, abuse, neglect, negligence, or unauthorized repair or modification of the Solution. Any fix, patch, or workaround provided as part of the foregoing remedy shall not re-commence the Warranty Period, and are warranted for the remainder of the Warranty Period, as then in effect.


DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SPECIFIED IN SECTION ?15(WARRANTY):

THE SOLUTION AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, AND GUARDICORE DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY), INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT OTHERWISE ARISE FROM A COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.
GUARDICORE MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE OR CONDITION (i) THAT THE SOLUTION WILL OPERATE IN THE COMBINATIONS WHICH CUSTOMER MAY SELECT FOR USE; (ii) REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS, USEFULNESS, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR QUALITY OF THE SOLUTION OR DOCUMENTATION; or (iii) THAT USE OF THE SOLUTION OR DOCUMENTATION WILL MEET ANY REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS OF CUSTOMER, OR WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE.

GUARDICORE INDEMNIFICATION
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, GuardiCore shall defend and hold harmless Customer against any third party demand, claim, suit, or action alleging that Customer's use of the Solution in accordance with this Agreement infringes such third party's copyright(s) or patent(s) (an "Infringement Claim"), and GuardiCore will pay any amounts finally awarded by a court against Customer (or otherwise agreed in settlement) under such Infringement Claim, as well as reimburse Customer for any documented expenses and legal fees (including a reasonable attorney's fee) actually incurred by Customer prior to its notifying GuardiCore of the Infringement Claim.
Customer must notify GuardiCore promptly after becoming aware of an Infringement Claim.

To the extent an implied warranty cannot be excluded, such warranty is limited in duration to the applicable warranty period. If end user made its purchase through a third party, Lenovo is not responsible for the representations or warranties made by such third party. Lenovo, its authorized third-party reseller(s), or its third-party suppliers do not warrant that the Lenovo Offerings will meet End User's requirements, or that the Lenovo Offerings will operate in the combinations which End User may select for use, or that the operation of the Lenovo Offerings will be uninterrupted or error-free.

Lenovo, its authorized thirdparty resellers or its authorized third-party suppliers are not responsible for pricing, typographical or other errors and reserves the right to cancel any orders arising from such errors as well as cancel, modify or discontinue Lenovo Offerings at any time. End User acknowledges that security in Lenovo Offerings does not guarantee the security of End User's network, and that End User is responsible for all other aspects of security, including without limitation, correct installation and setup of the security features of the Lenovo Offering and all related requirements, correctly configured security policies, selection of hardware and software (including network security tools), correct installation, configuration, and maintenance of the hardware and software, the interoperability of the various components of End User's network, and a physically and electronically secure operating environment. Due to interoperability requirements, End User acknowledges and agrees that the use of any Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, third-party software, may cause errors in the operation of the Software or may cause additional resolution time which may not be covered by Support or Services. End User agrees to pay Lenovo for any time spent by Lenovo diagnosing issues that result from use of Third-Party Products which shall be billed at Lenovo 's hourly billing rate. End User agrees to pay such amounts without deduction or set-off net 30 days from the date of invoice in United States ("U.S.") dollars.

5. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

Page 3 of 7

5.1. Confidentiality. Confidential Information means any information disclosed by Lenovo to End User, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, proprietary information, technical data, trade secrets (other than the Source Code) or know-how (including, without limitation, research, product plans, products, services, customers, markets, works of original authorship, photographs, negatives, digital images, software, computer programs, know-how, ideas, inventions (whether or not patentable), processes, formula, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing or finance documents and other technical, business, financial, customer and product development plans, forecasts, strategies and information), which is designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar designation by Lenovo or which the End User knows or has reason to known is regarded as confidential by Lenovo ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information may also include information disclosed to Lenovo by third parties. End User will at all times keep in confidence all such Confidential Information, and shall not use such Confidential Information without Lenovo 's written consent except in performance of End User's duties hereunder. End User may not disclose the Confidential Information to any person except its employees to whom it is necessary to disclose the Confidential Information for permissible internal business purposes and who have agreed to receive it under terms at least as restrictive as those specified in the Software Terms. End User's obligation to protect Confidential Information is satisfied if End User utilizes the same control over the Confidential Information as End User employs to avoid disclosure of End User's own confidential and valuable information (but no less than commercially reasonable control). End User will immediately give notice to Lenovo of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. End User agrees to assist Lenovo in remedying such unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. The foregoing obligations will not apply to the extent End User can demonstrate: (A) The disclosed Confidential Information was part of the public domain at the time of disclosure; (B) End User can establish by written evidence that the disclosed Confidential Information was in the possession of the End User at the time of its disclosure by Lenovo; (C) End User received the disclosed Confidential information from a third party without similar restrictions on disclosure and without breach of these Software Terms or any other agreement; or (D) End User is required to disclose the Confidential Information to a government agency to further the objectives of these Software Terms, such as to obtain permission to distribute the Lenovo Offering as permitted hereunder, or in the event a proper court of competent jurisdiction orders its disclosure; provided, however, that End User will use its best efforts to minimize the disclosure of such Confidential information and will consult with and assist Lenovo in obtaining a protective order prior to such disclosure.
5.2. Retention Rights. Lenovo may use any general learning, skills, or know-how or any information retained in the unaided memory of a person who had access to the End User's Confidential Information for any purpose. Lenovo is free to develop products independently and Lenovo is not obligated to restrict the future work assignments of people who have had access to End User's Confidential Information or to restrict Lenovo product development or plans in any way due to such access. Lenovo may use any technical information it derives from providing the Support relating to Service Request resolution, troubleshooting, functionality enhancements and fixes. In the event of an unauthorized use, distribution or disclosure of any Confidential Information, the parties agree that the harmed party will not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore, injunctive or other equitable relief may be appropriate to restrain such use, distribution or disclosure, whether threatened or actual. To the extent that Lenovo provides End User serial numbers, access codes, entitlement numbers or the license to access Software Services, or Support, End User is responsible for the security and use of such information, including that contained in the documentation therefore. If End User believes any Lenovo Confidential Information has been lost, stolen, or misused, End User must immediately notify Lenovo and its designated Support or Services contact.
5.3. Source Code. The Source Code constitutes a trade secret and may not be disclosed under these Software Terms or otherwise. End User may not disclose or use the Source Code without the express written consent of Lenovo.

You may request a refund for the Software within 30 days of Your initial purchase provided You return the Software to the Approved Source and disable or uninstall it. This paragraph does not apply where You have expressly agreed to end user license terms with Cisco as part of a transaction with an Approved Source.
Section 2. Using Cisco Technology
2.1. License and Right to Use. Cisco grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except with respect to Software as permitted under the Cisco Software Transfer and Re-Use Policy) (a) license to use the Software; and (b) right to use the Cloud Services, both as acquired from an Approved Source, for Your direct benefit during the Usage Term and as set out in Your Entitlement and this EULA (collectively, the "Usage Rights").
2.2. Use by Third Parties. You may permit Authorized Third Parties to exercise the Usage Rights on Your behalf, provided that You are responsible for (a) ensuring that such Authorized Third Parties comply with this EULA and (b) any breach of this EULA by such Authorized Third Parties.

If Cisco grants You Usage Rights in the applicable Cisco Technology on a trial, evaluation, beta or other free-of-charge basis ("Evaluation Software and Services"), You may only use the Evaluation Software and Services on a temporary basis for the period limited by the license key or specified by Cisco in writing. If there is no period identified, such use is limited to 30 days after the Evaluation Software and Services are made available to You. If You fail to stop using and/or return the Evaluation Software and Services or the equipment on which it is authorized for use by the end of the trial period, You may be invoiced for its list price and agree to pay such invoice. Cisco, in its discretion, may stop providing the Evaluation Software and Services at any time, at which point You will no longer have access to any related data, information, and files and must immediately cease using the Cisco Technology. The Evaluation Software and Services may not have been subject to Cisco's usual testing and quality assurance processes and may contain bugs, errors, or other issues. Except where agreed to in writing by Cisco, You will not put Evaluation Software and Services into production use. Cisco provides Evaluation Software and Services "AS-IS" without support or any express or implied warranty or indemnity for any problems or issues, and Cisco will not have any liability relating to Your use of the Evaluation Software and Services.
2.4. Upgrades or Additional Copies of Software. You may only use Upgrades or additional copies of the Software beyond Your license Entitlement if You have (a) acquired such rights under a support agreement covering the applicable Software; or (b) You have purchased the right to use Upgrades or additional copies separately.

2.6. Subscription Renewal. Usage Rights in Cisco Technology acquired on a subscription basis will automatically renew for the renewal period indicated on the order You or Your Cisco Partner placed with Cisco ("Renewal Term") unless: (a) You notify Your Approved Source in writing at least 45 days before the end of Your then-current Usage Term of Your intention not to renew; or (b) You or Your Cisco Partner elect not to auto-renew at the time of the initial order placed with Cisco. Your Approved Source will notify You reasonably in advance of any Renewal Term if there are fee changes. The new fees will apply for the upcoming Renewal Term unless You or Your Cisco Partner promptly notify Cisco in writing, before the renewal date, that You do not accept the fee changes. In that case, Your subscription will terminate at the end of the current Usage Term.
Section 3. Additional Conditions of Use

Unless expressly agreed by Cisco, You may not (a) transfer, sell, sublicense, monetize or make the functionality of any Cisco Technology available to any third party; (b) use the Software on second hand or refurbished Cisco equipment not authorized by Cisco, or use Software that is licensed for a specific device on a different device (except as permitted under Cisco's Software License Portability Policy); (c) remove, modify, or conceal any product identification, copyright, proprietary, intellectual property notices or other marks; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, decrypt, disassemble, modify, or make derivative works of the Cisco Technology; or (e) use Cisco Content other than as part of Your permitted use of the Cisco Technology.
3.2. Cloud Services. You will not intentionally (a) interfere with other customers' access to, or use of, the Cloud Service, or with its security; (b) facilitate the attack or disruption of the Cloud Service, including a denial of service attack, unauthorized access, penetration testing, crawling, or distribution of malware (including viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, spyware, adware, and cancelbots); (c) cause an unusual spike or increase in Your use of the Cloud Service that negatively impacts the Cloud Service's operation; or (d) submit any information that is not contemplated in the applicable Documentation.
3.3. Evolving Cisco Technology. Cisco may: (a) enhance or refine a Cloud Service, although in doing so, Cisco will not materially reduce the core functionality of that Cloud Service, except as contemplated in this Section; and (b) perform scheduled maintenance of the infrastructure and software used to provide a Cloud Service, during which time You may experience some disruption to that Cloud Service. Whenever reasonably practicable, Cisco will provide You with advance notice of such maintenance. You acknowledge that, from time to time, Cisco may need to perform emergency maintenance without providing You advance notice, during which time Cisco may temporarily suspend Your access to, and use of, the Cloud Service.
Cisco may end the life of Cisco Technology, including component functionality ("EOL"), by providing written notice on Cisco.com. If You or Your Cisco Partner prepaid a fee for Your use of the Cisco Technology that becomes EOL before the expiration of Your then-current Usage Term, Cisco will use commercially reasonable efforts to transition You to a substantially similar Cisco Technology. If Cisco does not have substantially similar Cisco Technology, then Cisco will credit You or Your Cisco Partner any unused portion of the prepaid fee for the Cisco Technology that has been declared EOL ("EOL Credit").

Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

= Non-GPL Components in Plugins and Drivers =
Plugins and drivers, including those provided by third parties, are considered derivative works of NVDA and must therefore be licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
As a special exception, an NVDA plugin or driver (as defined in the NVDA Developer Guide) may use components under other licenses provided that:
a) Any such component does not prevent the NVDA plugin or driver from being licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2; and
b) Any such component does not directly use and is not directly used by any portion of NVDA outside of that plugin or driver.
For example, a speech synthesizer driver may use a speech synthesiser under a proprietary license.
In contrast, in a plugin providing support for an application, the code which implements any interface provided by NVDA must be licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.

This license applies to eSpeak, available from httP://espeak.sourceforge.net/

```
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

```
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
(RevDate01June2018)

This End User License Agreement and the documents incorporated by reference below ("E-EULA") applies to any Software (meaning application, microcode, firmware, and operating system software in object code format) when the E-EULA is referenced or incorporated into any other document, and in any situation in which there are no other terms and conditions governing use of Software. This Software and associated materials contains proprietary and confidential information. Use of the Software is subject to, and expressly conditioned upon compliance with this E-EULA.

This E-EULA is a legally binding agreement between the entity that has obtained the Software ("End User") and Licensor (which may be a Dell Inc. Affiliate or an authorized reseller ("Reseller"), as explained below). If End User has a written, signed agreement with a Dell Inc. Affiliate that expressly provides for the licensing of Software, then that agreement, and not this E-EULA, will govern.

HOW TO DETERMINE THE LICENSOR

Buying Directly from a Dell Inc. Affiliate. If End User procured the Software license(s) directly from a Dell Inc. Affiliate, then the "Licensor" under this E-EULA is provided at www.dell.com/swlicensortable. This E-EULA governs End User's use of the Software and the Documentation (as defined below).

Buying From a Reseller. If End User procured the Software license(s) from a Reseller, then the Reseller may do one of the following to establish the Licensor and the license terms governing the Software and Documentation (as defined below):

Refer to the Manufacturer's License Terms or Remain Silent on Licensing Terms. When the Reseller refers End User to a direct license agreement with the software manufacturer, or Reseller says nothing about terms governing the licensing and use of the Software and Documentation, then this EEULA applies and the applicable Dell Inc. Affiliate identified at www.dell.com/swlicensortable is the "Licensor".

Sublicense the Software Rights using the Manufacturer's Terms. When the Reseller sublicenses the Software to End User by referring to the software manufacturer's license terms as the governing terms, then the terms of this E-EULA are deemed incorporated into Reseller's license agreement with the End User by reference. If this is case, Reseller is deemed the "Licensor" under this E-EULA.

1.

DEFINITIONS

A.

"Affiliate" of End User means a legal entity that is controlled by, controls, or is under common control

with End User. "Control" means more than 50% of the voting power or ownership interests. "Affiliate" of Dell

Inc. means any of Dell Inc.'s direct or indirect subsidiaries.

B.

"Documentation" means Licensor's then current, generally available End User manuals and online

help for Software.

C.

"Product Notice" means the information related to Software posted at a Dell Inc. Affiliate website,

currently located at http://www.EMC.com/products/warranty_maintenance/index.jsp. The Product Notice

informs End User of Software-specific use rights, restrictions, and definitions of units of measure. The Software-

related terms of the Product Notice in effect as of the date of the Quote will apply to the Software and are deemed

incorporated into this E-EULA.

Page 1 of 6

D.

"Quote" means the written quotation or other proposal for providing licenses to Software. Reseller or

a Dell Inc. Affiliate may issue a Quote to End User.

2.

SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

A.

General License Grant. Subject to and conditioned on End User's compliance with the terms of the E-

EULA and the Quote, Licensor grants to End User a revocable (according to Section 4 ("Termination") below),

non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software and Documentation during the license term stated

on the Quote for End User's internal business operations. If the Quote does not state a license term, then licenses

for Software are perpetual (subject to paragraph B ("Licensing Models") and Section 4 ("Termination") below).

Use of Software may require End User to complete a product registration process and input a license key. End

User may copy the Software and Documentation as necessary to install and run the Software in the quantity of

licensing units licensed, and otherwise only for reasonable back-up and archival purposes.

B.

Licensing Models. Licensor licenses Software for use only in accordance with the commercial terms

and restrictions of the Software's relevant software licensing model stated in the Product Notice, the Quote, or

both. For example, the licensing model may provide that End User may only use the Software for a certain

number of licensing units (e.g., storage capacity, instances, users), in connection with a certain piece of

equipment, CPU, network, or other hardware environment, or both. Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing,

Licensor licenses microcode, firmware, and operating system software shipped with equipment for use solely on

that equipment; the same applies to Software licensed together with the sale of equipment and designed to

enable the equipment to perform enhanced functions.

C.

License Restrictions. Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted to End User and does not

transfer any ownership rights in any Software. Without Licensor's prior written consent, End User must not, and

must not allow any third party to, do any of the following:

(1). (2). (3).
(4). (5). (6).
(7). (8). (9). (10).

use Software in an application services provider, service bureau, or similar capacity; disclose to any third party the results of any comparative or competitive analyses of Software done by or on behalf of End User; make available Software to anyone other than End User's employees or contractors who will use the Software on behalf of End User in a manner permitted by this E-EULA and the Quote ("Authorized Users"); except to the extent transfer may not legally be restricted under applicable law, transfer or sublicense Software or Documentation to an End User Affiliate or other third party; use Software in conflict with the terms and restrictions specified in this E-EULA or the Quote; except to the extent permitted by applicable mandatory law (meaning laws that parties cannot change by contract), modify, translate, enhance, or create derivative works from the Software, or reverse assemble, disassemble, reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Software; remove any copyright or other proprietary notices on or in any copies of Software or Documentation; violate or circumvent any technological use restrictions in the Software; use the Software or Documentation to create other software, products or technologies; or create Internet "links" to the Software or "frame" or "mirror" the Software.

D.

Records and Audit. During the Software license term and for two years after its expiration or

termination, End User must maintain accurate records of its use of the Software and Documentation sufficient

to show compliance with this E-EULA and the Quotes. During this period, Licensor or its auditors may request

that End User certify in writing that End User's use of the Software and Documentation complies with this E-

EULA and the Quotes, audit End User's use of Software and Documentation to confirm compliance, or both.

Licensor will provide End User with reasonable notice and conduct the audit during End User's normal business

hours and will not interfere unreasonably with End User's business activities when performing the audit. End

User must reasonably cooperate with the audit and must, without prejudice to Licensor's other rights, promptly

Page 2 of 6

buy additional licenses needed to put End User in compliance with the E-EULA and applicable Quotes. End User must also promptly reimburse Licensor for all reasonable costs of the audit if the audit reveals either that End User used Software in excess of the licenses that End User purchased when the excess usage is more than five percent in license value, or that End User did not maintain substantially accurate Software use records.

E.

Third Party Software License Terms. Third party software contained in or with the Software that

provides its own terms of use is governed by those provided terms.

3.

WARRANTIES AND SUPPORT. Under this EULA, Dell Inc. and its Affiliates do not provide any

warranties for the Software and do not provide support and maintenance services. End User's rights

under any warranties and any support service entitlements for the Software are solely between End User and

the entity from whom End User purchased the Software licenses, and are defined under the commercial terms

agreed between End User and that selling entity. If End User purchases support and maintenance from a

Reseller in the United States and Canada, then the Dell Inc. Affiliate's delivery of the maintenance and support

services is subject to the applicable terms set forth in the support services terms located at the Product Notice

website, unless otherwise defined in a separate sublicense, warranty and support, or related services terms

agreed between End User and the selling entity. Subject to the prior sentence, Dell Inc. and its Affiliates and

their suppliers provide the Software "As Is" without any warranties or conditions. To the maximum

extent permitted by applicable law, Dell Inc. and its Affiliates and their supplier: (i) make no express

warranties or conditions; (ii) disclaim all implied warranties and conditions, including merchantability,

fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement; and (iii) disclaim any warranty or condition

arising by statute, operation of law, course of dealing or performance, or usage of trade.

4.

TERMINATION. Licensor may terminate licenses if End User: (i) breaches the license terms and fails

to cure within thirty days after receipt of Licensor's written notice of breach; (ii) declares bankruptcy or is

adjudicated bankrupt or a receiver or trustee is appointed for substantially all of End User's assets. Dell Inc. or

its Affiliates may terminate licenses on ten days' written notice if End User fails to pay for the Software when

payment is not subject to a good faith dispute. Dell Inc. or its Affiliates may terminate the licenses immediately if

End User is acquired by or merged with a competitor of Dell Inc. or any of its Affiliates. If Licensor terminates

Software licenses, End User must cease all use of those Software licenses and associated Documentation, and

return or certify destruction of Documentation and Software pertaining to the terminated licenses. The provisions

of this E-EULA relating to records and audit, confidentiality, and liability will survive termination, along with any

other provisions of this E-EULA that, by their nature and context, are intended to survive.

5.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

A.

Limitations on Damages. Licensor does not license End User to use Software in situations in

which the failure of the Software could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical injury

or property damage. Neither party seeks to exclude or limit liability under this E-EULA for death or

personal injury resulting from negligence or any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.

(1). Limitation on Direct Damages. Licensor's total liability to End User is limited to the lower of: (i) the net license fees End User paid for the applicable Software license(s) that gave rise to the liability; or (ii) USD 100,000.

(2). No Indirect Damages. Licensor has no liability for special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, incidental, or indirect damages, or for lost profits, income, revenue, data (including corruption or damage to data), goodwill, reputation, or use of systems, networks, programs, or media.

B.

Regular Back-ups. End User is solely responsible for its data. End User must back up its data before

Licensor or a third party performs any remedial, upgrade, or other work on End User's production systems. If

applicable law prohibits exclusion of liability for lost data, then Licensor will only be liable for the cost of the

typical effort to recover the lost data from End User's last available back up.

Page 3 of 6

C.

Applicability. Even when the Reseller is the Licensor, the limitation of liability stated above will apply in

favor of Dell Inc. and its Affiliates, and it will apply to all End User claims, regardless of the course of action

(including tort).

6.

CONFIDENTIALITY. The Software and related materials, including the Documentation, are Dell Inc.

and its Affiliates' "Confidential Information". End User must treat the Confidential Information as confidential

in perpetuity unless and until the Confidential Information is or becomes part of the public domain through no

breach of confidentiality. End User must not use the Confidential Information beyond the scope of the rights

granted, and may only share it with Authorized Users who are subject to legal obligations consistent with this E-

EULA to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. End User is liable to Dell Inc. and its Affiliates

for all use of the Confidential Information by Authorized Users.

7.

MISCELLANEOUS

A.

Notices. The parties will provide all notices under this E-EULA in writing. Unless provided otherwise in

the Quote or on the invoice to End User, End User must provide notices to Dell Inc. and its Affiliates as follows:

by mail to: [Licensing Dell Entity Name], Attn: Contracts Manager, One Dell Way, Round Rock, Texas 78682, or

by e-mail to: Dell_Legal_Notices@dell.com. When the Licensor is a Reseller, End User must provide notice to

Reseller as stated in the agreement between End User and Reseller or as stated on Reseller's Quote to End

User.

B.

Assignment. End User may not assign this E-EULA or a Quote or any right or obligation under this E-

EULA or Quote, or delegate any performance, without Licensor's prior written consent. Even if Licensor consents

to an assignment, End User remains responsible for all obligations to Licensor under this E-EULA and each

Quote that End User incurred prior to the effective date of the assignment. End User attempts to assign or

delegate without Licensor's prior written consent are void. This section does not prohibit End User from

transferring Software and Documentation in accordance with Section 2.C.(4) above. In case of such transfer,

End User must notify Licensor of the transfer in writing and impose all obligations under this E-EULA on the

transferee.

C.

Governing Law and Venue. This E-EULA and any dispute, claim, or controversy (whether in contract,

tort, or otherwise) related to or arising out of this E-EULA or any Quotes between End User and Dell Inc. or one

of its Affiliates ("Dispute") is governed by the law of the applicable jurisdiction stated in

www.dell.com/swlicensortable ("Governing Jurisdiction"). The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the

International Sale of Goods does not apply. Any Disputes must be brought in the courts of the Governing

Jurisdiction. The parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts within the Governing

Jurisdiction in connection with any Disputes. The parties further waive all objections to the exercise of personal

jurisdiction over the parties by those courts, and to venue in those courts, with respect to any such Disputes.

The parties agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to a jury trial with respect to any

Dispute. Neither party is entitled to join or consolidate claims by or against other users, or pursue any claim as

a representative or class action, or in private attorney general capacity, in connection with a Dispute.

D.

Informal Dispute Resolution. As a condition precedent to filing any lawsuit, a party must first provide

written notice of any Dispute to the other party. The parties will attempt to resolve any Dispute through

negotiation with persons fully authorized to resolve the Dispute, or through mediation utilizing a mutually

agreeable mediator before proceeding with litigation. The parties to a Dispute must treat the existence or results

of any negotiation or mediation as confidential. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty days

of notice of the Dispute to the other party (or other mutually agreed period), the parties will be free to pursue all

remedies available at law or in equity in accordance with Section 7C above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a

party may immediately file a lawsuit for injunctive relief to protect intellectual property rights, preserve the status

quo, or prevent irreparable harm.

E.

Waiver. Failure to enforce a provision of this E-EULA will not constitute a waiver of that or any other

provision of this E-EULA.

Page 4 of 6

F.

Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors for all purposes under this E-EULA

and cannot obligate any other party without prior written approval. The parties do not intend anything in this E-

EULA to allow any party to act as an agent or representative of a party, or the parties to act as joint venturers or

partners for any purpose. No party is responsible for the acts or omissions of any other.

G. Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines any part of this E-EULA or document that incorporates this E-EULA by reference is unenforceable, that ruling will not affect the validity of all remaining parts.

H.

Trade Compliance. Customer's purchase of licenses for Software and access to related technology

("Materials") are for its own use, not for resale, export, re-export, or transfer. End User is subject to and

responsible for compliance with the export control and economic sanctions laws of the United States and other

applicable jurisdictions. Materials may not be used, sold, leased, exported, imported, re-exported, or transferred

except with prior written authorization by Dell Inc. or its Affiliates and in compliance with such laws, including,

without limitation, export licensing requirements, end-user, end-use, and end-destination restrictions, and

prohibitions on dealings with sanctioned individuals and entities, including but not limited to persons on the Office

of Foreign Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or the U.S. Department of

Commerce Denied Persons List. End User represents and warrants that it is not the subject or target of, and

that End User is not located in a country or territory (including without limitation, North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Syria,

and Crimea) that is the subject or target of, economic sanctions of the United States or other applicable

jurisdictions. End User understands and will comply with all applicable provisions of the U.S. Arms Export

Control Act (AECA) and the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) in End User's receipt, use,

transfer, modification, or disposal of Software. End User acknowledges that any use, modification, or integration

of the Software in or with defense articles or in the provision of defense services is not authorized by any

Licensor, and that Licensors will not provide warranty, repair, customer support, or other services in connection

with such end uses. End User certifies that any software, disk images, or other data provided to Licensor in

connection with the purchase of the Software will not contain technical data, software, or technology controlled

by the ITAR or AECA, and that if End User later returns the Software to Licensor or grants Licensor access to

the Software, End User will not include or otherwise make available to Licensor any such technical data,

software, or technology. End User agrees to indemnify and hold Licensor harmless for any liability, loss,

damage, cost, expense, or penalty arising from End User's non-compliance with the AECA, ITAR, or the

provisions of this Section.

I.

Purchases from Reseller; Third Party Beneficiaries. When a Reseller is the Licensor, End User

acknowledges that the sublicense it receives from Reseller is conditional on the license grant from Dell Inc. or

its Affiliates to Reseller, and that Reseller cannot grant to End User license rights greater than Reseller received

from such entity. The applicable Dell Inc. Affiliates a third party beneficiary to the license agreement between

the Reseller and End User and is entitled to exercise and enforce all of Reseller's rights and benefits under such

license agreement (including the terms of this E-EULA

J. Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence. This E-EULA comprises the complete statement of the agreement of the parties with regard to its subject matter and may be modified only in a writing signed by both parties. Regardless of the prior sentence, Dell may in its sole discretion, update the Licensor table and Product Notice incorporated by reference into this E-EULA. Any changes that Dell Inc. makes to the Licensor table and Product Notice will apply only to transactions that occur after Licensor posts those changes online. The E-EULA excludes all terms of any End User purchase order or similar End User document, such as any preprinted terms, and any terms that supplement, are inconsistent or that conflict with this E-EULA, the Quote, or both. These excluded terms have no legal effect and do not modify or supplement the E-EULA, even if Licensor does not expressly object to those terms when accepting an End User purchase order or similar document. When a subject is discussed in this E-EULA and also in a Quote or a separate agreement that incorporates this E-EULA, then that subject will be governed by the terms in this E-EULA. Any claims by any party of fraud in the inducement of this E-EULA or any Quote or End User purchase order based on any statements, representations, understandings, or omissions, whether oral or written, that are not fully expressed in this E-EULA, the applicable

Page 5 of 6

Quote, or purchase order are expressly waived and released. End User represents that it did not rely on any representations or statements that do not appear in this E-EULA when accepting this E-EULA.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMS TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS LICENSE, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, FOR EVALUATION SOFTWARE AND IT IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. Evaluation software has a non-perpetual time limited license that will "time-out" and disable the software upon expiration of the evaluation period. You will not attempt to defeat or circumvent any duration mechanism for Evaluation Software and you will not use any Evaluation Software beyond the prescribed license duration.
(3) Software Hosted in a Public Cloud. If you use the Software in a public cloud environment, you may only use the Software in object code form in the cloud provider's ("Cloud Provider") environment. In accordance with Section 3(e), you may not copy any portion of the Software out of the Cloud Provider environment. Each instance of the Software running in the Cloud Provider's environment requires its own license key when you are using a bring-your-ownlicense offering from the Cloud Provider. If you are using a utility offering (e.g., hourly) from the Cloud Provider, each instance is licensed and paid for separately within the Cloud Provider's infrastructure. IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS SET FORTH IN SECTION 8(d) BELOW, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMS TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS LICENSE OR ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF THE APPLICABLE CLOUD OR SIMILAR ENVIRONMENT, SOFTWARE PROVIDED BY A CLOUD PROVIDER AND NOT OBTAINED FROM F5 IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS.
4. Third Party Materials.
(a) Open Source Components. Certain portions of the Software contain open source software ("Open Source Components") that are licensed under the terms of the applicable open source licenses ("Open Source Licenses"). You are bound by and shall comply with the Open Source Licenses. A listing of the Open Source Components, and links to the Open Source Licenses, can be found in the Documentation. You may reference the applicable Product's Open Source Notices and Software Acknowledgments document at http://askf5.com. To the extent the terms of the Open Source Licenses require us to make available to you the corresponding source code and/or modifications (the "Open Source Code"), you may obtain a copy of the applicable Open Source Code from its current location at https://downloads.f5.com, or by sending us a written request with your name and address to the notice address specified in Section 13(b). All requests should identify: the Open Source Code that you are requesting, the applicable Software (and any available version information) that you have licensed from us in connection with the requested Open Source Code, your email contact information, and the postal address for delivery of the requested Open Source Code to you. This offer to obtain a copy of the Open Source Code is valid for three (3) years from the date you have licensed the Software.

Use of either the Software or Documentation or both constitutes agreement by the government that the Software and Documentation are "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" and constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions herein.
